<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> story of Don Alden is the story of Boston
during the British occupation. Like the sturdy
out-of-doors boy of to-day, Don was fond of
hunting and fishing and trapping; it is of little
wonder therefore that Glen Drake, the old
trapper from the North, formed an instant liking
for him.</p>

<p>But from the moment that the Port Bill went
into effect—yes, and before that unfortunate
event—there were other things than hunting and
fishing to think about. Don’s aunt, a heroic,
kindly woman of old New England, refused to
leave her home in Pudding Lane, even though
the town seemed likely to become a battle ground.
And Don was not the boy to forsake his aunt in
time of need.</p>

<p>How he helped her during the period of
occupation; how he acted when his best friend
cast his lot with the Tories; what he did when he
suddenly found that he could save the life of one
of the hated Redcoats; and what happened at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
end when Crean Brush’s Tories forced their way
into the house—those events and many others
only go to prove that heroism is not limited by
age.</p>

<p>There were other things also to test the
courage of a lad like Don—the Battles of Concord
and Lexington and of Bunker Hill, the
felling of the Liberty Tree, and the many small
annoyances that both Tories and Redcoats committed
to make life a little more miserable for the
suffering townsfolk. But he met them all in
such a way as to deserve the words of praise from
the one man whom he admired more than any
other—General Washington.</p>

<p>Boston in the days of the Revolution resembled
Boston of to-day in one noticeable respect:
many of the streets were narrow and
crooked and bore the names that they bear at
present. But the differences between the old
town and the new are many and astonishing. In
Revolutionary days mud flats, which were exposed
at low water, lay where South Boston and
the Back Bay are now situated; near where the
present North Station stands there used to be a
broad placid mill-pond that extended down
almost to Hanover Street; and to the south,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
where to-day many broad streets and avenues
cross one another over a wide space, there used to
be a very narrow strip of land known as the Neck—to
have cut it would have made of the town an
island. Such in brief was the Boston of Donald
Alden and of his friends.</p>

<p>If Don is a fictitious hero he is at least typical
of many another patriot lad who, too young to
serve a great cause under arms, did serve it nevertheless
as best he could. How he cared for his
Aunt Martha throughout the long trying months
of British occupation and in the end foiled Crean
Brush’s Tories and performed a service for General
Washington makes a story that is well within
the beaten paths of history.</p>

<p>The facts of history, taken alone, are likely to
seem cold and colorless; regarded from the point
of view of a hero in whom we are interested, and
whose life they are affecting, they glow with
warmth and romance. If readers who follow the
adventures of Don find that at the end of the
story the Tea Party, Bunker Hill, Lexington
and Concord and other important events of
history are a little more real to them than they
were at first, I shall be content. That is one of
the purposes of the book. The other, and perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the more important, is simply to provide an
interesting story of a boy—a Patriot Lad of Old
Boston.</p>

<small>TEA AND SALT WATER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A pink</span> and golden sunset was flaming across
Boston Common. It was one of the prettiest
sunsets of the whole winter of 1773; but on that
day, the sixteenth of December, few persons were
in the mood to stop and admire it. For trouble
had come to town.</p>

<p>In the Old South Meeting-House at the
corner of Marlborough and Milk Streets the
largest and perhaps the most important town-meeting
in the history of Boston was in session.
The hall was filled to overflowing, and those who
had been unable to gain admittance lingered in
the streets and tried to learn from their neighbors
what was going on inside.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of the crowd in Milk Street
two boys were talking earnestly. “This is a bad
piece of business,” said one in a low voice.
“What right have we to protest against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
King’s sending tea to his colonies? We’re his
loyal subjects, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>His companion, an alert-looking boy with blue
eyes, did not reply at once; but his eyes flashed
as he glanced restlessly now at the meeting-house,
now at the persons round him, many of whom he
knew. At last he said, “Of course we’re loyal,
but we’re not represented in Parliament; for that
reason we shouldn’t be taxed. The protest is not
against the tea but against the tax that the King
has put on it. At least that’s what my Uncle
Dave says.”</p>

<p>“Now see here, Don,” replied the boy who had
spoken first, “there’s going to be trouble just as
sure as you’re born. Take my advice and don’t
pick the wrong side.” He lowered his voice.
“Keep away from trouble-makers. Men like
Sam Adams inside there are a disgrace to the
town; and anyway they can’t accomplish anything.
There are three shiploads of tea at Griffin’s
Wharf; it will be landed to-night, and before
many days have passed, you and I will be
drinking it—as we should. Don’t be a fool,
Don!”</p>

<p>Donald Alden lifted his chin a trifle. “I don’t
intend to be a fool, Tom,” he replied slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>His companion, Tom Bullard, the son of one
of the wealthiest men in town, seemed pleased
with the remark, though he certainly was not
pleased with what was going on about him.
From time to time he scowled as the sound of
hand-clapping came from within the meeting-house,
or as he overheard some snatch of conversation
close by. “Cap’n Rotch,” a tall, rugged-faced
man was saying to his neighbor, “has gone
with some others to Milton to ask the governor
for a clearance.”</p>

<p>“Old Hutchinson will never give it to them,”
was the quick reply. “He’s as bad as King
George.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, if he doesn’t, you watch out and
see what happens.” With that advice the tall
man smiled in a peculiar way and a few minutes
later left his companion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the crowd had increased to almost
twice the size it had been when Don and Tom
had joined it. Don guessed that there were between
six and seven thousand people inside the
meeting-house and in the streets close by it, and
he was astonished at the quiet nature of the
gathering. Although everyone around him
seemed uneasy and excited, yet they talked in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
ordinary tones of voice. Occasionally a small
boy would shout as he chased another in play, but
for the most part even the small boys were content
to wait quietly and see what was about to
happen; for it seemed that something must happen
soon.</p>

<p>Almost all of the pink and gold had faded from
the sky, and a light breeze was swaying some of
the signs over the doors of the shops on Milk
Street and making them creak. There were
lights flashing in many of the windows; and inside
the Old South Meeting candles were burning.</p>

<p>Don and Tom edged as near as they could to
the door, which was partly open. They could
hear someone speaking, though the words were
indistinct; they could see the heads and shoulders
of some of the listeners; they could see grotesque
shadows flit about the walls and ceiling as somebody
moved in front of the flickering candles.
It was long past supper-time, but few persons
seemed to have any thought for food.</p>

<p>“I’m cold,” said Tom, “and hungry too.
Aren’t you, Don?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Don.</p>

<p>He lifted his hands to loosen his collar; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
were trembling but not with cold. Something
must happen soon, he thought.</p>

<p>Somewhere a bell was tolling, and the tones
seemed to shiver in the chill air. Half an hour
dragged by, slowly. And then there was a
sudden commotion near the door of the church,
and the buzz of conversation rose to a higher
pitch. “It’s Rotch!” exclaimed someone.
“It’s Rotch,” said another; “and Governor
Hutchinson has refused clearance.”</p>

<p>The crowd pressed closer to the door. Don
could see people moving about inside the meeting-house.
Then he saw somebody at the far end
of the hall lift his hand, and he barely distinguished
the words: “This meeting can do nothing
more to save the country.”</p>

<p>An instant later there was a shout from someone
on the little porch of the church, and then the
startling sound of war-whoops rang in Marlborough
Street. In a moment the people in the
church began to pour out of the door. In Milk
Street, near Bishop’s Alley, Don spied half a
dozen figures clothed in blankets and wearing
feathered head-dresses; their faces were copper-colored,
and all of them carried hatchets or axes.
Where they had come from no one seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
have any clear idea, but as they started down the
street others joined them; and the crowd followed.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Don?” Tom asked
sharply as his companion turned to join the
throng in Milk Street.</p>

<p>“He’s going to have a look at the King’s tea,
aren’t you, my lad?” said a voice near by.</p>

<p>“Come on along,” cried Don.</p>

<p>But Tom seized his companion’s arm and held
him. “Don, are you crazy?” he demanded.
“Keep out of this; it’s trouble; that’s what it
is——”</p>

<p>Don jerked his arm free and ran ahead; soon
he was lost to Tom in the crowd. At Long
Lane he caught a glimpse of bobbing head-dresses.
He started to run as best he could.
Once he stumbled and fell to his knees, but somebody
helped him quickly to his feet. “No time
to stumble now,” said the stranger, whoever he
was.</p>

<p>A few moments later those at the head of the
throng turned sharply to the right, and as they
stumbled over the cobblestones down a narrow
street Don observed that the moon was shining.
In and out among the streets the throng went,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
past Cow Lane, past Belcher’s Lane and straight
toward Griffin’s Wharf. Everyone was excited,
and yet there was a certain order about the whole
movement.</p>

<p>“Remember what Rowe said in meeting?” remarked
a florid-faced man whom Don recognized
as a grocer from King Street. “‘Who knows
how tea will mingle with salt water?’ Well, I
guess we’ll all know pretty quick.”</p>

<p>Don felt his heart take a sudden leap. So they
were going to throw the tea overboard! These
were no Indians; they were Colonists, all of them!
He thought he even recognized one of the leaders
as the tall, rugged-faced man in the crowd who
had advised his companions to wait and see what
would happen if the governor refused the
clearance.</p>

<p>Once on the wharf, the first thing the men did
was to post guards, and then Don noticed that all
of the little copper-colored band had pistols as
well as hatchets and axes. The <i>Dartmouth</i> was
the first ship to be boarded; someone demanded
that the hatches be opened, and the sailors complied
with the demand at once; there was no resistance.
In a moment square chests with
strange markings were being lifted to the deck.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Again Don observed that everything was being
done in an orderly manner.</p>

<p>It was a night that he should long remember.
The tide was low, and the three Indiamen with
their high sides and ornamented sterns reminded
him of huge dragons lying beside the wharf in
the moonlight. He saw chest after chest broken
open with axes and hatchets and then tumbled
overboard into the water; he heard the low voices
of the men as they worked—they seemed to be
talking in Indian dialect, though he knew that
it was not genuine, for now and again he would
catch a word or two of English.</p>

<p>For a while Don leaned against one of the
great warehouses and tried to guess who the
“Indians” were; at one time he counted as
many as fifteen of them, but he could not be sure
that there were not more; for at least a hundred
persons were on the wharf, helping to get rid of
the tea. Some of the chests that they tossed
overboard lodged on the mud flats that were out
of water, but young men and boys waded in and
broke them into pieces and pushed them off. It
was fascinating to watch the destruction.</p>

<p>Don remained near the warehouse for perhaps
three hours; and not until the last chest had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
tossed from the <i>Eleanor</i> and the <i>Beaver</i>, the other
two tea vessels, did he realize that he was
hungry; he had entirely forgotten that he had
missed his supper.</p>

<p>Taking one last glance at the pieces of broken
chests, which the turning tide was now carrying
out into the harbor, he set forth toward home.
At the head of Atkinson Street he heard someone
call his name, and, turning, he saw Tom Bullard
close behind him. “Oh, Don, wait a minute.”</p>

<p>Don paused. “I can’t wait very long,” he
said and grinned. “My Aunt Martha won’t be
very well pleased with me as it is.”</p>

<p>“See here, Don,” began Tom abruptly, “I
know where you’ve come from, and I know
what’s happened down at the wharf. I know
also that those men weren’t Indians. The thing
I want to ask you is, what do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“Why,” replied Don slowly, “I’m afraid it
won’t please you, Tom, if I tell. I think we—that
is, the Indians,—did the proper thing in
throwing the tea overboard.”</p>

<p>Tom stiffened. “So you’re a young rebel,”
he said. “A young rebel! Well, I thought so
all along. I’m through with you from now on.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Tom; we’ve been good friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Well, I’m not sorry,” replied Tom, turning
part way round. “A young rebel!” he repeated,
flinging the words over his shoulder. “Well,
look out for trouble, that’s all.” And he crossed
the street.</p>

<p>Don bit his lips. He had lost an old friend;
Tom was a Tory. Well, he was not astonished;
but he had hoped that their friendship might last
through their differences.</p>

<p>He felt somewhat depressed as he made his
way along the crooked streets to his aunt’s little
house in Pudding Lane. No light was burning
in the store at the front where his aunt sold
groceries and odds and ends of a household
nature to eke out the income of his Uncle David,
who was employed at MacNeal’s rope yard on
Hutchinson Street. He entered the small sitting-room
at the back of the house. “Hello,
Aunt Martha,” he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Donald Alden, for goodness’ sake, where
have you been?” Aunt Martha Hollis dropped
the stocking that she had been knitting and adjusted
her spectacles.</p>

<p>“Well, first I went up to the town-meeting.”</p>

<p>“Did you see your Uncle David there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“No, ma’am; there was an awful big crowd.
I’m pretty hungry, Aunt Martha.”</p>

<p>“What happened at the meeting?”</p>

<p>“Well, there was a lot of talking, and then
just as it broke up, a band of Indians—that is,
a band of men with tomahawks and feathers and
colored faces—appeared in Milk Street and
started down to Griffin’s Wharf and—is there
any pie, Aunt Martha?”</p>

<p>“Donald, go on!” said his aunt, whose fingers
had begun to tremble violently.</p>

<p>“They boarded the three tea ships and tossed
all the tea into the water. My, you should have
seen them! Then they went home. Aunt
Martha, I certainly am hungry.”</p>

<p>“Was—was anybody hurt, Donald?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, ma’am—except one man whom I
didn’t know; a chest of tea fell on him. Another
man tried to put some of the tea into his
pockets, but I guess he was more scared than
hurt.”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha drew a deep breath and rose
from her chair. In a few minutes she had placed
some cold meat and potatoes and a large slice of
apple pie on the table. “Now don’t eat too
fast,” she cautioned her nephew. Then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
seated herself again, but she did not go on with
her knitting.</p>

<p>She was a little woman with blue eyes and
silvery hair parted in the middle. She was
naturally of a light-hearted disposition, though
perhaps somewhat overly zealous for the welfare
of her only nephew, whom she had taken to live
with her eight years ago on the death of both his
parents. Now her eyes were gravely thoughtful
as she watched him eating.</p>

<p>“This is mighty good pie, Aunt Martha.”</p>

<p>“Well, eat it slowly, then, for that’s all you
can have.”</p>

<p>Don grinned and held up his empty plate, and
a moment later his aunt went to the kitchen and
returned with another piece. As she was setting
it on the table, the door opened, and David
Hollis entered. He nodded and smiled at his
nephew and then strode quickly into the kitchen,
where Don heard him washing his hands and face.
Then Don heard his aunt and uncle talking in
subdued voices. When they entered the sitting-room
again Aunt Martha carried more meat and
potatoes, which she placed on the table.</p>

<p>Uncle David, big and broad and hearty, sat
down opposite his nephew. “So you were at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
wharf this evening?” he inquired. “Did you see
the—the Indians?”</p>

<p>“I saw feathers and tomahawks and painted
faces,” replied Don, and Uncle David laughed
and quickly lowered his hands to his lap, but not
before his nephew had caught a glimpse of dark
red paint round the finger-nails.</p>

<p>“It was a bold thing that the Mohawks did,”
said Uncle David. “Don’t ever forget, Donald,
that the men who tossed that tea overboard were
Indians.”</p>

<p>Don nodded and, turning to his aunt, said,
“This is awfully good pie, Aunt Martha.
Maybe there’s another piece——”</p>

<p>“Donald! Of course not!” Nevertheless,
Aunt Martha went again to the kitchen cupboard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>DON FINDS A NEW FRIEND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the next few days the destruction of
the King’s tea was the main topic of conversation
in and round Boston. Moreover, bells were
rung in celebration of the event, and some persons
said frankly that they believed the act to be
a stroke toward independence. David Hollis
said so one day at the dinner-table.</p>

<p>When he had gone out Aunt Martha turned to
her nephew. “Donald,” she said, “your uncle
is a good man, a brave man, and he is usually
right; but, oh, I do hope that this time he is
wrong. Do you realize what it will mean if the
Colonies declare their independence of England?”</p>

<p>“It will mean fighting,” Don replied.</p>

<p>“Yes, it will mean—war.” Aunt Martha’s
voice trembled. “War between us and our own
kinsmen with whom we have been close friends
for so long.”</p>

<p>Don thought of Tom Bullard, but he said
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“I do hope that things will be settled peaceably
before long,” said his aunt.</p>

<p>Not many days had passed before the inhabitants
of Boston learned that tea ships that had
tried to land cargoes at New York and at
Charleston had fared no better than the three
Indiamen at Boston. And again the people of
Boston rejoiced, for they were sure that they had
done right in destroying the tea.</p>

<p>For a while Don found things very quiet at
the little house in Pudding Lane. He went
regularly to the Latin School in School Street
and after hours frequently helped his aunt to look
after the store. He saw Tom Bullard almost
every day, but Tom had not a word to say to his
former close friend.</p>

<p>One day shortly after Christmas the two boys
met unexpectedly near Tom’s house in Hanover
Street. Don stopped short. “Say, Tom,” he
said, “don’t you think we might be friends again
even if we can’t agree on all things?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to be friendly—with you,” replied
Tom shortly.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, then,” said Don.</p>

<p>For several minutes he was indignant and
angry; then he decided that the best thing for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
him to do would be to forget the quarrel, and
from that moment he did not allow it to worry
him.</p>

<p>The winter dragged on slowly. January
passed, and February came and went. There
had been plenty of sledding on the Common;
and there were numerous ponds and swamps,
where Don tried his new upturned skates
that his Uncle David had given him on his birthday.</p>

<p>March was drawing to a close when Don unexpectedly
found a new friend. It was Sunday
evening, and Aunt Martha and Uncle David and
Don were seated in front of a roaring fire on the
hearth, when two loud knocks sounded at the
door. Before Uncle David could get to his feet
it swung open, and a short heavy-set man dressed
in deerskin entered.</p>

<p>“Glen Drake!” exclaimed Uncle David.
“By the stars, what in the world brings you out
of the woods?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just meandered down,” replied the
other, clasping the outstretched hand. “Thought
maybe you’d be glad to see me.”</p>

<p>“Glad? I surely am! Here—you know
Aunt Martha.” Glen Drake shook hands with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Don’s aunt. “And here—this is my nephew
Donald.”</p>

<p>Don felt the bones in his hand fairly grate as
the man pressed it.</p>

<p>“Draw up a chair, Glen,” said Uncle
David.</p>

<p>But Glen Drake had crossed to the door and
slipped outside. In a moment he was back,
carrying a large bundle in both arms. “A little
present for Aunt Martha,” he said and dropped
it on the floor in the centre of the room. “There’s
a silver fox among ’em.”</p>

<p>“Furs!” cried Don.</p>

<p>“Why, Glen Drake,” began Aunt Martha,
“you don’t mean to say——”</p>

<p>“Best year I ever had,” said Glen and, kneeling,
cut the thong that bound the bundle.</p>

<p>Don’s eyes seemed fairly to be popping from
his head as he watched the old trapper lift pelt
after pelt from the closely-packed pile. There
must have easily been several thousand dollars’
worth there on the floor. Perhaps one-fourth of
the pelts were muskrat; the rest were beaver,
otter, mink, martin, sable, ermine and finally the
trapper’s greatest prize—a silver fox.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say——” Aunt Martha<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
began again. “Why, you surely don’t intend to
give me all these!”</p>

<p>At that the old trapper threw back his head
and laughed for fully half a minute. “All!” he
exclaimed. “Why, bless your heart, Aunt
Martha, you should have seen the catch I made.
This isn’t one-fifth—no, not one-tenth!”</p>

<p>He seated himself in front of the fire and
began to fill his pipe. “Never saw so much fur
in my life,” he said.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” Uncle David asked.</p>

<p>“Up Quebec way and beyond.”</p>

<p>While the two men were talking, Don not only
listened eagerly, but studied the visitor closely.
He was a short man with broad sloping shoulders
and a pair of long heavy arms. His musket,
which he had carried in when he went to get the
furs, lay beside his coonskin cap on the floor.
Though the weapon lay several feet from him,
Don was sure that the man could get it in a fraction
of a second, if he needed it badly; for he had
crossed the floor with the quick noiseless tread of
a cat. Now he was lying back in his chair, and
his deep-set black eyes seemed to sparkle and
burn in the moving light of the fire. His face
was like dark tanned leather drawn over high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
cheek bones; his hair was long and jet black.
His pipe seemed twice the size of Uncle David’s
when it was in his mouth, but when the trapper’s
sinewy hand closed over the bowl it seemed very
small. Glen Drake was just the sort of man to
catch a boy’s fancy.</p>

<p>All evening Don sat enthralled, listening to
the stories the man told of the north, and Aunt
Martha had to use all her power of persuasion to
send her nephew off to bed. “No more pie for a
week, Donald, unless you go this instant,” she
said at last.</p>

<p>“You like pie, Don?” asked the trapper.
“Well, so do I. And I like boys also, and since
I hope to be here for some little time maybe you
and I can get to be real friendly.”</p>

<p>“I—I surely hope so!” said Don and turned
reluctantly toward the stairs.</p>

<p>He did not go to sleep at once; his room was
directly above the sitting-room, and he could hear
his uncle and Glen Drake talking until late into
the night.</p>

<p>The month that followed was a delightful one
for Don. After school hours he and the old
trapper would often cross the Neck and go for
a long walk through Cambridge and far beyond.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
The backbone of winter was broken; spring was
well along, and the birds had returned from the
south. Glen knew them all, by sight and by
sound, and he was willing and even eager to teach
his companion; he taught him also the habits of
the fur-bearing animals and the best ways to trap
them; he taught him how to fish the streams, the
baits to use and the various outdoor methods of
cooking the fish they landed.</p>

<p>“I declare,” said Glen one evening in May
when they were returning with a fine mess of
fish, “you’re the quickest boy to learn a thing
ever I knew. I’m as proud of ye as if you were
my own son.”</p>

<p>Don felt a thrill pass over him; he had not expected
such praise as that. “I hope I can learn
a lot more,” he said.</p>

<p>But that was the last trip the two made into
the country together for a long time. On arriving
at the house in Pudding Lane, they found
Uncle David pacing nervously back and forth
across the floor.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Dave?” asked Glen.</p>

<p>“Matter enough; haven’t you heard?” Uncle
David paused. Then he said with a note of
anger in his voice: “I was sure all along that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the King would take some means of revenge for
the affair of the tea, but it’s worse than I’d suspected.
He’s going to close the port.”</p>

<p>Glen Drake whistled softly. Don paused at
the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>“Military governor is coming first,” continued
Uncle David, “and troops later—Redcoats!”</p>

<p>“That won’t help the town,” said the trapper.</p>

<p>“You’re right; and it won’t help me; I’ve got a
good supply of merchandise in the cellar—cloth
mostly and a little powder. Bought it last week
from the captain of the <i>Sea Breeze</i> and offered
it right off to a friend of mine in Carolina, but
can’t send it till I hear from him and know
whether he wants it. By that time, though, I’m
afraid there won’t be any ships sailing.”</p>

<p>“Sell it here in town,” suggested Glen.</p>

<p>“Can’t do it; my offer was as good as a
promise.”</p>

<p>“Send it overland, then, though that would
be more expensive, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would be; there wouldn’t be any profit
left.”</p>

<p>But during the stress of the next few days
Uncle David quite forgot about his merchandise.
Captain-General Thomas Gage had arrived in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
ship from England; and on the seventeenth of
May he landed at Long Wharf and as military
governor was received with ceremony. On the
first of June, amid the tolling of bells and fasting
and prayer on the part of most of the good
people of Boston, the Port Bill went into effect.
A few days later Governor Hutchinson sailed for
England.</p>

<p>Uncle David was moody and preoccupied.
He and Glen spent much of their time in the
North End, and Don could not help wondering
what they were doing there. He and the trapper
had become such close friends that he missed
his old companion greatly. “Where do they go
every evening?” he asked his aunt.</p>

<p>“You must not ask too many questions,
Donald,” Aunt Martha replied.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Don, “how long will the port be
closed?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. All I can say is that it is a
wicked measure; I declare it is!”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha’s words soon proved to be only
too true. Hundreds of vessels, prevented from
sailing by the British fleet, lay idle at the wharfs.
Hundreds of persons walked the streets, out of
work; and many of the very poor people were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
without bread. Day by day the town seemed to
grow a little more miserable. And still Aunt
Martha hoped that there would be a peaceful
settlement between the Colonies and the mother
country. Uncle David and Glen Drake said
very little except when they thought they were
quite alone.</p>

<p>Don went frequently to the Common, where
Redcoats were encamped; in the course of the
summer the number of them increased. Barracks
had been erected, and cannon had been
placed at various points of vantage. It looked
as if the British were preparing for a long stay.</p>

<p>Once Don overheard a conversation between
two of the soldiers that made his blood boil. He
was waiting for a school chum near the Province
House, which General Gage was occupying as
headquarters, when two Redcoats turned the
corner at Rawson’s Lane and stopped near him.
“We’ll teach these people how to behave in the
future,” said one.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty hard for them,” remarked the
other, “having all their trade cut off and having
a lot of their liberties taken from them.”</p>

<p>“Hard!” exclaimed the first speaker. “It’s
meant to be hard. Everything is done purposely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
to vex them. They talk of liberty; we’ll show
’em what liberty means. Maybe when they feel
the pinch of starvation they’ll come to understand.
Maybe they’ll need powder and ball to
make them behave, but they’ll behave in the
end!”</p>

<p>Don turned away, and from that moment he
hoped that a time would come when the people
of the Colonies would rise and drive the hated
soldiers from the town. If he were only a little
older! If he could only do something!</p>

<p>That evening when he returned to Pudding
Lane he found the table set for only two persons.
“Why, Aunt Martha,” he said, “where are
Uncle Dave and Glen?”</p>

<p>“They’ve gone on a trip southward. They
won’t return for perhaps a week or two.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Don, “did they go to see about the
consignment of goods in the cellar?”</p>

<p>“They could see about that,” Aunt Martha
replied slowly.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the two men had gone on
a special trip to New York. For some time they,
together with such men as Paul Revere, a silversmith
in the North End, William Dawes and
others had been meeting in secret at the Green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Dragon Tavern; they were part of the Committee
of Correspondence, and their object was to
watch the British, learn all they could about them—where
they kept their guns and powder, how
many there were of them at various points—and
to convey the information to the other Colonies.
Uncle David had ceased work at the rope yard,
and if Aunt Martha had known all the details of
his doings at the Green Dragon she might have
worried even more than she did. His mission
now was, among other matters, to inform the
Committee of Correspondence at New York of
the arrival of a fresh regiment of Redcoats.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>A REDCOAT GETS WET</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the absence of Glen Drake, Don had
formed the habit of going down to the wharves
and watching the great ships that lay in forced
idleness. The boys that he knew were divided
sharply between Whigs and Tories, though most
of them were Whigs like himself. So far he had
found no one with whom he could be as intimate
as he had been with Tom Bullard; so he spent
much of his time alone.</p>

<p>On the first day of September, Don was on his
way to the water-front when he observed an excited
group of sailors and townsmen on the
opposite side of the street; they were talking
loudly and making violent gestures with their
hands. He crossed just in time to hear one of
the sailors say: “I was down at Long Wharf and
saw them go early this morning—more than two
hundred Redcoats in thirteen boats!”</p>

<p>“And they went to Winter Hill,” exclaimed
another, “broke open the powder house and
carried off two hundred and fifty half-barrels!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
And a second detachment went to Cambridge
and brought back two field-pieces that belong to
the militia. Thieving Redcoats! It’s high time
Congress took some measures to oust ’em!”</p>

<p>“Have patience, Jim,” said a third. “Our
time will come, see if it doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“Patience! We’ve shown too much of it
already.”</p>

<p>Before Don reached home the news of the raids
had spread all over town. People were discussing
it on the street corners and in public meeting,
and many persons were of a mind to organize at
once and recapture as much of the stores as possible.</p>

<p>The Powder Alarm, as it was called, spread
rapidly. Messengers from the Committees of
Correspondence carried the news to the other
Colonies, and the whole country soon blazed with
indignation; as a result Lieutenant Governor
Oliver and other important officers of the Crown
were forced to resign. General Gage began at
once to fortify Boston Neck, and then the flame
of indignation blazed brighter.</p>

<p>In the midst of the excitement Uncle David
and Glen Drake returned with the information
that all the people of the other Colonies had “all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
their eyes turned on Boston.” “We’ll have to
open hostilities before long,” Don’s uncle
declared. “Human nature can bear just so
much—then look out!”</p>

<p>“O David!” cried Aunt Martha. “You
seem to be anxious for bloodshed. You do indeed!”</p>

<p>“I’m anxious for justice,” replied Uncle
David.</p>

<p>“Ye can torment a critter just so far, Aunt
Martha,” said Glen; “then it’ll turn and fight.
I don’t care what it is—mink, otter or even a poor
little muskrat. And when it does fight it fights
like fury. It’s not only human nature, but the
nature of every living critter.”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha was silent, and Don, observing
the old trapper’s powerful fingers as he tightened
the lacing in one of his boots, secretly wished that
he were old enough to carry a musket in one of
the companies of militia.</p>

<p>Two days later the two men were off on separate
missions to the west and south, and again
Don was left alone with his aunt.</p>

<p>One Saturday afternoon late in September he
took a long walk with his dog, a young terrier
that a sailor on one of the ships at Woodman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Wharf had given him in exchange for three cakes
of maple sugar and a set of dominoes. Up past
the Faneuil Hall the two went, past the Green
Dragon Tavern and along to the shipyard at
Hudson’s Point, the dog tugging eagerly at his
leash, and Don holding him back.</p>

<p>For a while Don stood in Lynn Street, looking
across the water at Charlestown and enjoying the
cold wind that was sweeping in from the east. So
far he had not found a name for the dog, and he
was walking along thoughtfully when he caught
sight of a red-coated figure standing at the approach
to Ruck’s Wharf and talking with—why,
it was Tom Bullard! Don stopped short and
then turned to watch the tide, which was sweeping
round the point. What was Tom doing,
talking with a Redcoat? On second thought Don
realized that Tories and Redcoats had only too
much in common these days. He was on the
point of resuming his walk when he heard someone
shout at the end of the wharf, and, turning,
he saw a man in a small sloop holding something
upraised in his hand. Tom and the soldier
started toward the sloop, laughing. Then Don
observed that it was a bottle that the man in the
boat was holding. “Tom’s found bad company,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
I’m afraid,” he thought and again resumed his
walk.</p>

<p>On coming opposite the end of the wharf, he
observed that Tom had gone aboard the sloop;
he had crossed on a narrow plank stretched between
the boat and the dock. The soldier, a tall,
well-built fellow, had started across at a swinging
gait. He had passed the middle and was
only a few feet from the sloop when, apparently,
the narrow plank tilted sidewise. “Look out!”
Don heard Tom shout.</p>

<p>The soldier threw out both arms, balanced uncertainly
for several seconds, took two short quick
steps and then slipped. Don saw the man’s hat
fly off and go sailing in the wind. The next
instant the soldier struck the water with a
tremendous splash.</p>

<p>Tom Bullard stood with open mouth, looking
down at the black water that had closed over the
head of the soldier. The man with the bottle ran
to get a rope, but by the time he reached the
gunwale again the soldier reappeared a dozen
yards from the bow, uttered a gurgling shout and
sank even as the man on board made his cast.</p>

<p>Don’s fingers had tightened round the leash;
his eyes were wide, and his breath came quickly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Then, letting go the leash, he ran to the edge of
the wharf. He paused and in two swift movements
tore off his jacket; then he felt a stab of
doubt. What was he thinking of? Save a Redcoat!
He thought of his uncle and of Glen
Drake; he thought of all the wrongs the town
was suffering at the hands of the King’s soldiers—their
insolent conduct on the streets, their
hatred of the townsfolk. Then he thought of his
aunt. That thought settled it. As the tide
swept the man to the surface for the third time,
Don jumped.</p>

<p>The water was like ice. He strangled as a
wave struck him in the face just as his head came
to the surface. He caught a glimpse of a dark
red mass of cloth a dozen yards at his left; it
seemed rapidly to be taking on the color of the
water round it. Kicking with all his might, he
struck out toward it, swinging his arms with
short, quick strokes. Everything was confusion—air,
sky, water. A great weight seemed to be
pressing against his chest. Then one foot struck
something hard. In an instant he had turned and
plunged downward. All was water now, black,
cold and sinister. His fingers closed on something
soft—it might be seaweed. He struggled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
upward. His lungs seemed on the point of
bursting. Upward, upward—then a rush of air
and light. A bundle of sodden red cloth came up
beside him.</p>

<p>“Grab the wharf!” someone shouted.</p>

<p>But Don did not hear. He took a stroke with
his free hand, and at that moment a length of
heavy rope whipped down across his arm. Seizing
it, he held on. Then he saw that the tide had
carried him and his burden against the piling of
the next wharf.</p>

<p>“Hold him a moment longer,” said a voice, and
then three red-faced sailors lowered themselves
like monkeys, and two of them lifted the soldier
out of the water. The third caught Don by the
back of his shirt and pulled him upward.</p>

<p>On the splintery planks of the wharf, Don
blinked his eyes and looked about him. A group
of men were carrying the Redcoat into a warehouse.</p>

<p>“How do you feel, my lad?” asked the sailor
who had pulled Don from the water.</p>

<p>“C-C-Cold.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, stand up. You did a plucky
thing. Too bad the fellow was a Redcoat.”</p>

<p>“Is—is he alive?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“Oh, yes; he’ll stand parade to-morrow all
right. I’m sorry for that. How I hate ’em!”</p>

<p>Don caught a glimpse of Tom Bullard entering
the warehouse. Then a low, plaintive cry
sounded behind him, and, looking over the edge of
the wharf, he saw his terrier in the water. “My
pup!” exclaimed Don. “Get him somebody,
please!”</p>

<p>A good-sized group of persons had gathered
round the boy by that time, and the sailor and two
other men hastened to rescue the dog. Once on
the wharf, the terrier ran to his young master and
began to leap up on him.</p>

<p>“Get the boy to a warm place,” said a lanky
fisherman and grasped Don by one arm.</p>

<p>The sailor who had pulled him from the water
placed himself on the other side, and together the
three of them started down the street at a rapid
pace. Soon Don felt a warm glow all over his
body; nevertheless his teeth were chattering, and
with each puff of strong wind he shivered.</p>

<p>“Wish it had been old Gage instead of a common
Redcoat,” the sailor was saying.</p>

<p>“Same here,” replied his companion. “You’d
have pushed him under when you pulled the lad
out, wouldn’t you, Hank?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“You’re right, I would have done just
that.”</p>

<p>Down one street and into another the three
hurried and then paused in front of a tavern with
a swinging sign-board that bore the grotesque
figure of a green dragon. “Here’s Revere’s
place,” said the sailor. “In we go.”</p>

<p>Don soon found himself seated in front of a
blazing wood-fire in a large room. It was the
first time he had ever entered the Green Dragon
Tavern. He glanced round the low-ceilinged
room—at the long table, at the rows of pewter on
the walls, at the dozen or more chairs with shiny
rounded backs. Then he moved as close to the
fire as he could with safety, and soon steam was
rising from his shoes and stockings. The dog
curled up on the hearth and blinked now at the
boy, now at the blazing logs.</p>

<p>Hank left the room and returned a few
minutes later with a bowl of broth and a cup of
strong tea. “You needn’t be afraid of this tea,
my lad,” he said and grinned. “Nobody’s paid
a tax on it.” He winked at the fisherman.
“See if you can find some dry clothes about the
place, John.”</p>

<p>Don finished the broth and was sipping the hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
tea when a big, rugged-faced man strode into the
room, and Don recognized Paul Revere.</p>

<p>“This is the boy,” said John.</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Revere. “David Hollis’s
nephew, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Don.</p>

<p>“They tell me you saved a Redcoat.”</p>

<p>“I did, sir,” replied Don. “He couldn’t
swim.”</p>

<p>“What’ll your uncle say to that?” The man
smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know.” Indeed the question
had occurred to Don several times before.
What would Glen Drake say? Don felt his face
grow hot; he thought he ought to say something
more. “I—wouldn’t pick a Redcoat to save—if
I had my choice,” he added.</p>

<p>Revere laughed heartily. “No, I don’t believe
you would,” he said. “Well, I’ll have some
clothes for you in a trice. Put ’em on in the
other room; you can return ’em to-morrow or
next day.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Don said good-bye to Hank
and John and set forth toward the house in
Pudding Lane. Twilight was coming on, but
Don was not sorry for that. He thought of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
miserable figure that he must present to passers-by.
The coat he wore was several sizes too large
for him; he had turned up the sleeves three times,
and still they reached to his knuckles. The
trousers were so big that he felt as if he were
walking in a burlap bag. The hat, which was
his own, was wet and misshapen. And at his
heels trotted a wet, shivering terrier; no leash
was necessary now.</p>

<p>What would his aunt say? And then he happened
to remember that the day was Saturday.
“Why, I declare,” he said to himself. “Uncle
Dave and Glen are expected home to-night.”</p>

<p>He quickened his steps as he crossed the
cobblestones on King Street. He was thinking
of just how he should begin his story, but suddenly
in the midst of his thoughts he stopped and
looked at the pup. “I believe I’ve found a name
for you!” he said.</p>

<p>The pup wagged his tail.</p>

<p>“I can’t call you Redcoat or soldier, but since
it was a sailor I got you of, and a sailor that
pulled both of us out of the water, I’m going to
call you—Sailor!”</p>

<p>The pup’s tail wagged more vigorously, as if
he were content with the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Don reached his aunt’s house; there was a light
in the store; he entered and passed through to
the sitting-room. Uncle David and Glen evidently
had been home for some little while, for
they were both seated comfortably beside a
candle, reading the <i>Massachusetts Spy</i> and the
<i>Boston Gazette</i>. They looked up as Don
entered, and Aunt Martha, who had just come
from the kitchen, dropped a plateful of doughnuts
and gave a little cry.</p>

<p>“Where you been, Don, to get such clothes as
those?” asked Glen.</p>

<p>“Donald Alden, I couldn’t believe it was you,”
said Aunt Martha. “How you frightened me!”</p>

<p>“Scarecrow come to town,” said David Hollis.</p>

<p>Don helped to pick up the doughnuts, adding
as he held the last one, “This one’s dirty, Aunt
Martha; I’ll eat it.” Then he told what had
happened to him on his afternoon walk, and
Uncle David’s face glowed while he listened,
though Don could not tell whether it was with
satisfaction or with anger. “Did I do what was
right, Uncle Dave?” he asked when he had concluded
the narrative.</p>

<p>David Hollis did not reply at once, but Aunt
Martha said quickly, “You did, Donald; but,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
my dear boy, what a risk you took! Don’t ever
do such a thing again—that is,” she hastened to
add, “don’t do it unless you have to.” The
good lady seemed to be having a hard time adjusting
her spectacles.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Uncle David at last, “your Aunt
Martha is right, Don.” He laughed and added,
“You did right, but don’t do it again unless you
have to.”</p>

<p>Glen Drake nodded and bent over the <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>A TRIP TO CONCORD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day was Sunday, a bleak, damp day
that most of the good people of Boston were content
to spend indoors. Snow was falling in large
wet flakes that melted almost as soon as they
struck the sidewalks. The great elms on the
Common tossed their gaunt black branches in the
wind; and on the water-front the flakes of snow
whirled downward among the spars of the idle
shipping and vanished into the black water.</p>

<p>In Pudding Lane, Aunt Martha and the two
men had finished dinner, and Don was munching
his fourth doughnut, when a knock sounded at
the door. “Now who can that be?” asked Don’s
aunt.</p>

<p>Uncle David opened the door and disclosed a
tall, well-built man in the bright uniform of a
British soldier. “Good day to you, sir,” said the
Redcoat and took off his hat.</p>

<p>“Good day to you.” David Hollis’s tone was
by no means hospitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“You have a boy—a boy who is called Donald—Donald
Alden, I think.”</p>

<p>Uncle David nodded. “Be so kind as to step
inside. The day is bleak.”</p>

<p>The soldier crossed the threshold, and David
Hollis closed the door and stood stiffly with his
hand on the latch. Glen Drake had stopped in
the act of filling his pipe. Aunt Martha’s lips
were pursed, and her eyes were wide open. For
a moment or two no one spoke. Then the
soldier looked at Don, who had hastily swallowed
the last of the doughnut. “This boy,” he said,
“saved my life yesterday. I should be a most
ungrateful man if I allowed the act to pass without
a word. Be sure that I am grateful.
Harry Hawkins is my name, private in His
Majesty’s 43rd Regiment. If I can be of any
service to you, Master Donald,” he added with a
smile, “I shall be indebted to you until I have
performed it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” Don replied. “I had no
hope of reward when I plunged from the dock.”</p>

<p>The man smiled faintly and turned as if to go.</p>

<p>“You and your fellows might act with a little
more consideration for folks who wish only to be
left alone in justice,” said Uncle David.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“I am a soldier; I obey my King,” the man
replied and stepped to the door. “I wish you all
good day.”</p>

<p>David Hollis closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>“I like that fellow for three things,” said Glen
Drake abruptly. “He’s grateful to Don here,
as he should be; he didn’t offer the lad money for
saving his life; and he said what he had to say
and then made tracks.”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha nodded and sighed, but Uncle
David kept a stubborn silence.</p>

<p>As for Don, he admitted afterward to his aunt
that he liked the looks of Harry Hawkins better
than he liked the looks of any Redcoat he had
ever seen, and that he was really glad that he had
been able to save the man’s life. “I like him
far better than I like a Tory,” he added with considerable
spirit.</p>

<p>Indeed a good many people were far more
bitter against the Tories than they were against
the Redcoats, who after all had behaved pretty
well under somewhat trying conditions. By
now, the middle of November, there were eleven
regiments of Redcoats, most of which were
grouped on and round the Common; there was
also artillery; and the following month five hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
marines landed from the <i>Asia</i>. Earl Percy
was in command of the army, and a formidable
looking force it was, on parade.</p>

<p>But the Colonies also had an army. Uncle
David and Glen Drake, on returning from their
frequent journeys, brought much news of what
was happening outside the town. The conviction
was fast becoming general that force and
force alone could settle the whole matter; and to
that end Alarm List Companies of Minute-Men
were being formed in the various towns, and supplies
and ammunition were being collected and
stored for future use. “By Hector,” Glen remarked
on one occasion, “right out here in
Danvers the deacon of the parish is captain
of the Minute-Men, and the minister is his
lieutenant! Donald, if you were only a mite
older—but then again maybe it’s best that you’re
not.”</p>

<p>By the first of the new year the force of Redcoats
in Boston had increased to approximately
thirty-five hundred; and, moreover, General
Timothy Ruggles, the leader of the Tories, was
doing his best to aid the soldiers in every possible
way. Tom Bullard, it seems, was acting as a
kind of aide to the general and had accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
him several times on missions to the Tory town of
Marshfield.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Don,” said Glen one day, “watching
this trouble is a whole lot like watching a
forest fire. It started with only a few sparks,
like the Stamp Act, you might say; now it’s
burning faster and faster every minute. It
won’t be long before it blazes up bright, and then
it’ll have to burn itself out.”</p>

<p>“How soon is it likely to blaze up?”</p>

<p>“Mighty soon, I’m a-thinking.”</p>

<p>Glen’s estimate was correct. In March the
people of Boston saw a marked change in the behavior
of the troops. On the fifth of the month,
which was the anniversary of the Boston
Massacre, the address that Dr. Warren made was
hissed by perhaps twoscore of officers who had
attended the Old South just for that purpose.
And on the sixteenth, a day of fasting and
prayer, soldiers of the King’s Own Regiment
acted in a way that filled Aunt Martha with indignation.</p>

<p>She and Don had gone to church early.
Shortly before the service began, old Mrs. Lancaster,
who lived across the way in Pudding
Lane, came in and remarked that soldiers were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
pitching their tents outside. A few minutes
later, in the midst of the service, the sounds of fife
and drum came from the street. The minister
stopped his sermon and looked round him.</p>

<p>Aunt Martha bit her lips, and two bright pink
spots showed on her cheeks. “This is scandalous!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“It’s downright wicked!” said old Mrs. Lancaster.</p>

<p>The minister went on with the service, raising
his voice to make himself heard; but Don, and
doubtless many others, had little thought for
what was being said inside the church.</p>

<p>At the end of the service many of the people
hurried past the soldiers on their way home;
but others stood and watched with indignant
glances.</p>

<p>That event was only one of many other irritations
that followed and inflamed the hearts of the
townsfolk.</p>

<p>“Aunt Martha, war has got to come,” said
Don.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of it, Donald,” she replied, and
Don glanced once at his aunt’s face and wished
that he had held his tongue in the first place; his
aunt’s eyes were red and moist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“All that cloth and powder is still in the cellar,
isn’t it?” he asked a while later.</p>

<p>“Yes, Donald; and your uncle intends to keep
it there until he can find a satisfactory way of
getting it out, though what with all the trouble
that surrounds us, I do believe that he doesn’t
often give it a thought any more.”</p>

<p>“Seems too bad not to sell it,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve said so myself, but he always nods
and says, ‘Yes, that’s right,’ and then his mind
goes wandering off on—on other matters.”</p>

<p>David Hollis, and indeed all the members of
the Committees of Correspondence, had many
matters to keep them busy. A close watch was
being kept on the troops in town. It was known
that Gage had sent two officers in disguise to
make maps of the roads that led to Boston; and
rumor had it that he intended to send a strong
force to Concord to capture supplies that the
patriots had stored there.</p>

<p>The month of March dragged past with war-like
preparations on both sides. Many of the
townsfolk, realizing that open hostilities must
begin soon, had moved into the country. Samuel
Adams and John Hancock had gone to Lexington,
where they were staying with the Rev. Jonas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Clark. David Hollis and Glen Drake had both
made several trips to the town with messages for
them.</p>

<p>One day early in April, David Hollis took his
wife aside out of hearing of his nephew.
“Martha,” he said in a low voice, “I want you to
leave the house for a while. There’s going to be
trouble, and Boston will be no safe place for
you.”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha’s chin lifted a trifle. “And,
pray, where should I go?” she asked.</p>

<p>“To Cousin Deborah’s in Concord.”</p>

<p>“I shall not go!” Aunt Martha replied.</p>

<p>“But she has already prepared for you; I told
her you’d come.”</p>

<p>“You had no right to say that.”</p>

<p>“But, Martha, listen to reason. I say there
will be trouble—I know it! And it’s coming
soon. Need I speak plainer than that?”</p>

<p>“No, David, you need not. I understand.
Yet I intend to remain right here in our home.”</p>

<p>David Hollis threw out his hands and turned
away. Then with another gesture he said,
“Martha Hollis, you are a foolish woman. I—I
command you to go; it is for your own good.”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha’s blue eyes flashed behind her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
spectacles. “And I refuse to obey. My place
is here, and here is where I stay.” Then with a
sudden flash of anger she exclaimed, “I’d like
to see any Redcoats drive me from my own
home!”</p>

<p>David Hollis turned toward the fire and
snapped his fingers several times. “It’s too
bad,” he said. “Stubbornness is not a virtue.”</p>

<p>“You have it!”</p>

<p>Uncle David made no reply.</p>

<p>“You tell Cousin Deborah that I’m sorry she
has gone to any trouble about me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect to go that way very soon.”</p>

<p>“Then Glen can see her.”</p>

<p>“Glen has gone—elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha was thoughtful. “Well,” she
said at last, “as you say, it is too bad, but, David,
my mind is made up.”</p>

<p>“How would it be to send Donald? Seems to
me it might be a good vacation for him. He’s an
able lad, and I know that he’d be glad to make
the trip. He could ride almost as far as Lexington
with Harry Henderson. Cousin Deborah
would be glad to have him for overnight.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said Aunt Martha. “I can’t
allow it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>But in the end she yielded, and that evening
Don heard the news with glee. “Your cousin is
a nervous, exact kind of person,” his aunt told
him, “and I want you to tell her everything that
I say.”</p>

<p>“But what is it?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Tell her that I am very sorry she has gone to
any trouble on my account, but that I cannot
with a clear conscience visit with her at this time.
Say also that when your uncle promised for me he
had not consulted me and therefore did not know
all the facts.”</p>

<p>“She’ll want to know the facts,” said Don,
grinning. “I’m kind of curious myself, Aunt
Martha.”</p>

<p>“Donald!”</p>

<p>But Don’s grin was irresistible, and his aunt
smiled. “Never mind,” she said. “And you’ll
hurry home, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I surely will, Aunt Martha.”</p>

<p>The next morning, the sixteenth of April, Don
set out with Harry Henderson, a raw-boned
young fellow with red hair and a short growth of
red stubble on his face. The soldiers had just
finished standing parade on the Common when
Don and Harry rattled by in the cart; Harry’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
light blue eyes narrowed as he watched them
moving in little groups to their barracks.</p>

<p>“Good morning to you, young sir,” said a
cheerful voice.</p>

<p>Don, looking up, saw Harry Hawkins.
“Good morning to you, sir,” he replied.</p>

<p>Harry Henderson looked at his companion
narrowly. “Friend of yours?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“Friend of your uncle’s maybe?” Harry
was grinning impudently now, and Don’s cheeks
were red.</p>

<p>“No; here’s how it is——” And Don gave a
brief account of how he had happened to meet
the Redcoat.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harry dryly, “I should think he
might say good morning to you.”</p>

<p>They passed the Common and finally turned
into Orange Street and, after some delay, drove
past the fortifications on the Neck. “Clear of
’em b’gosh!” said Harry, cracking his whip.
“We’ll reach Lexin’ton by mid-afternoon if old
Dan here doesn’t bust a leg.”</p>

<p>But Harry had not reckoned on horseshoes.
Shortly before they reached Medford, old Dan
lost a shoe, and the circumstance caused a delay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
of two hours. Then later Dan shied at a barking
dog and snapped one of the shafts. As a
result Harry and Don did not reach Lexington
until almost ten o’clock.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to stay right here with me,” said
Harry, “It’s too late for you to reach Concord.
I know your cousin, and she wouldn’t be at all
pleased to have you wake her at midnight—not
she!” He laughed.</p>

<p>So Don remained at Lexington overnight and
the next morning set out on foot for Concord.
He reached his cousin’s house just before noon.</p>

<p>Cousin Deborah was a tall strong-looking
woman with black hair, black eyes and a nose that
was overly large. She had once been a school
teacher and, as David Hollis used to say, had
never lost the look. “Where’s your Aunt
Martha?” were her first words to Don.</p>

<p>“She decided she couldn’t come.”</p>

<p>“But Uncle David told me——”</p>

<p>Then followed the inevitable questions that a
person like Cousin Deborah would be sure to ask,
and Don wriggled under each of them. But
after all, Cousin Deborah was good-hearted, and
deep within her she knew that she would have
done the same as Don’s aunt was doing, if she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
had been in similar circumstances—though she
would not acknowledge it now. “Your aunt
always did have a broad streak of will,” she said
severely. “Now I want you to spend several
days with me, Donald.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Martha told me to hurry back.”</p>

<p>“That means you can stay to-night and to-morrow
night,” Cousin Deborah decided. “I’ll
have dinner in a few moments, and then I want
you to tell me all the things that have happened
in Boston.”</p>

<p>In spite of his cousin’s questions, which were
many and varied, Don managed to enjoy himself
while he was at Concord. On the second day he
met a boy of his own age, and the two fished all
morning from the North Bridge. In the afternoon
they went on a long tramp into the woods
along the stream.</p>

<p>At night Don was tired out and was glad when
his cousin finally snuffed the candles and led the
way up-stairs. He was asleep shortly after his
head struck the pillow.</p>

<p>That night proved to be one of the most eventful
in the history of the Colonies.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE REGULARS COME OUT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Don was asleep, breathing the damp,
fragrant air that blew over the rolling hills and
fields round Concord, his friend, Paul Revere,
was being rowed cautiously from the vicinity of
Hudson’s Point toward Charlestown. It was
then near half-past ten o’clock.</p>

<p>Revere, muffled in a long cloak, sat in the stern
of the small boat and glanced now at his two
companions—Thomas Richardson and Joshua
Bentley—and now at the British man-of-war,
<i>Somerset</i>, only a few rods off. The tide was at
young flood, and the moon was rising. The
night seemed all black and silver—black shadows
ahead where the town of Charlestown lay, black
shadows behind that shrouded the wharfs and
shipyards of the North End, and silver shimmering
splashes on the uneasy water and on the
sleek spars of the <i>Somerset</i>.</p>

<p>The sound of talking came from the direction
of the man-of-war and was followed by a burst of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
laughter that reverberated musically in the cool
night air. Revere blew on his hands to warm
them. The little boat drew nearer, nearer to
Charlestown; now he could see the vague outlines
of wharfs and houses. Several times he glanced
over his shoulder in the direction of a solitary
yellow light that gleamed in the black-and-silver
night high among the shadows on the Boston
side,—a light that burned steadily in the belfry of
the Old North Meeting-House behind Corps Hill
as a signal that the British were on their way by
land to attack the Colonists.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said one of the rowers, shipping
his muffled oar and partly turning in his
seat.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the boat swung against
a wharf, and the two men at the oars held it
steady while Revere stepped out. A brief word
or two and he was on his way up the dock. In
the town he soon met a group of patriots, one of
whom, Richard Devens, got a horse for him.
Revere lost no time in mounting and setting off
to warn the countryside of the coming of the
Redcoats.</p>

<p>He had not gone far beyond Charlestown
Neck, however, when he almost rode into two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
British officers who were waiting in the shadows
beneath a tree. One of them rode out into the
middle of the path; the other charged full at the
American. Like a flash Revere turned his horse
and galloped back toward the Neck and then
pushed for the Medford road. The Redcoat, unfamiliar
with the ground, had ridden into a clay
pit, and before he could get his horse free Revere
was safely out of his reach.</p>

<p>At Medford he roused the captain of the
Minute-Men; and from there to Lexington he
stopped at almost every house along the road and
summoned the inmates from their beds. It was
close to midnight when he reached Lexington.
Riding to the house of the Rev. Jonas Clark,
where Hancock and Adams were staying, he
found eight men on guard in command of a sergeant.</p>

<p>“Don’t make so much noise!” cried the fellow
as Revere clattered up to the gate.</p>

<p>“Noise!” repeated Revere in a hoarse voice.
“You’ll have noise enough here before long—the
regulars are coming out!”</p>

<p>At that moment a window opened, and Hancock
thrust his head out. “Come in, Revere!”
he said. “We’re not afraid of <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Revere dismounted and hurried inside. In a
few words he told his story, that the British were
on their way either to capture Hancock and
Adams or to destroy the military stores at Concord.
While he was talking, William Dawes,
who also had set out to warn the people, clattered
up to the door.</p>

<p>After he and Revere had had something to eat
and to drink they started for Concord and were
joined by a Dr. Prescott, whom Don had seen
once or twice in company with his uncle. With
Revere in the lead the party rode on at a rapid
pace.</p>

<p>About half-way to Concord, while Prescott and
Dawes were rousing the people in a house near
the road, Revere spied two horsemen ahead.
Turning in his saddle, he shouted to his companions,
and at that moment two more horsemen
appeared.</p>

<p>Prescott came riding forward in answer to the
shout, and he and Revere tried to get past the
men, all of whom were British officers. But the
four of them were armed, and they forced the
Americans into a pasture. Prescott at once
urged his horse into a gallop, jumped a stone
wall and, riding in headlong flight, was soon safe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
on his way to Concord. Revere urged his horse
toward a near-by wood, but just before he
reached it six British officers rode out, and he
was a prisoner.</p>

<p>“Are you an express?” demanded one of
them.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Revere and with a smile added:
“Gentlemen, you have missed your aim. I left
Boston after your troops had landed at Lechemere
Point, and if I had not been certain that the
people, to the distance of fifty miles into the
country, had been notified of your movements I
would have risked one shot before you should
have taken me.”</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke; it was clear that
the Redcoats were taken aback. Then followed
more questions, all of which Revere answered
truthfully and without hesitating. Finally they
ordered their prisoner to mount, and all rode
slowly toward Lexington. They were not far
from the meeting-house when the crash of
musketry shook the night air.</p>

<p>For an instant the major who was in command
of the party thought they had been fired on.
Then he remarked to the officer beside him, “It’s
the militia.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>The officer laughed shortly and glanced at
their prisoner. Then the party halted, and the
British took Revere’s horse. The major asked
him how far it was to Cambridge and, on being
told, left the prisoner standing in the field and
with the rest of the party rode toward the meeting-house.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Revere crossed the old
burying-ground and entered the town. He soon
found Hancock and Adams again and told them
what had happened, and they concluded to take
refuge in the town of Woburn. Revere went
with them. He had done his duty.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a vague feeling of impending
danger, perhaps it was the mere twitter of a bird
outside his window—at any rate Don awoke with
a start. All was darkness in the room. A light,
cool wind stirred the branches of the great elm at
the side of the house; he could hear the twigs rubbing
gently against the rough shingles. He had
no idea what time it was; it must be after midnight,
he thought; but somehow he was not
sleepy. He raised his head a trifle. Down-stairs
a door slammed; that seemed strange.
Now someone was talking. “I wonder——” he
said to himself and then sat bolt upright in bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>The church bell had begun to ring at a furious
rate. Clang, clang! Clang—clang! Don thought
he had never before heard a bell ring so harshly
or so unevenly. He jumped out of bed and
began to dress. Clang! Clang! What in the
world could be the matter? He could hear
shouts now and the sound of hastening footsteps.
In his excitement he got the wrong arm into his
shirt. Clang! Clang—clang! He found his
shoes at last and with trembling fingers got them
on his feet. He unlatched the door and started
carefully down the winding stairs. It seemed as
if there were a hundred steps to those creaking
old stairs. Twice he almost missed his footing—and
all the while the bell continued to clash and
ring and tremble.</p>

<p>In the sitting-room a single candle was burning.
Don got a glimpse of his cousin Deborah,
hastily dressed and still wearing her nightcap;
she was standing at the door, and his Cousin
Eben, with a musket in his hand and a powder
horn over his shoulder, was saying good-bye.
Don saw him kiss his wife. Then the door
opened, the candle flickered, and he was gone.</p>

<p>“Cousin Deborah, what’s wrong?” cried
Don.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“The regulars are coming!” And then
Cousin Deborah burst into tears.</p>

<p>Don bit his lips; he had never thought of his
cousin as being capable of tears.</p>

<p>They did not last long. A few movements of
her handkerchief and Cousin Deborah seemed
like herself again. “Donald,” she said, “they
have begun it, and the good Lord is always on
the side of the right. Now I want you to go back
to bed and get your rest.”</p>

<p>“Are you going back to bed, Cousin Deborah?”</p>

<p>“No; there will be no sleep for me this night.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall remain up also,” replied Don.</p>

<p>Cousin Deborah made no protest but went to
the stove and poked the fire.</p>

<p>The bell had ceased ringing now. The town
of Concord was wide awake.</p>

<p>While Don and his cousin were eating a hastily
prepared breakfast the Minute-Men and the
militia assembled on the parade ground near the
meeting-house. Meanwhile other patriots were
hard at work transporting the military stores to
a place of safety.</p>

<p>Dawn was breaking, and the mist was rising
from the river when Don and his cousin finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
got up from the table. “Now, Donald,” said
Cousin Deborah, “I’ve been thinking all along
of your Aunt Martha and blaming myself for
my selfishness in having you stay here with me
for so long. I’d give most anything if you were
back there with her. And yet——” She
paused frowning.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can get back all right,” said Don confidently.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Why, by keeping off the roads as much as
possible. I know the country pretty well.”</p>

<p>“You’re a bright lad, Donald,” said Cousin
Deborah. “You’re a bright lad; and I don’t
know but what you’d better start. Your aunt
needs you more than I do. But oh, Donald,
you’ll be cautious!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ought to leave you here
alone.”</p>

<p>“Drat the boy!” exclaimed his cousin and then
smiled. “Bless you, Donald,” she added, “I’ll
be safe enough. I shall go to Mrs. Barton’s
until things are quiet again. Now go and get
yourself ready.”</p>

<p>Don needed only a few moments in which to
get his things together. Then he walked with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
his cousin as far as Mrs. Barton’s house, which
was situated some distance beyond the North
Bridge, bade her good-bye and started back. It
was growing lighter every minute now, and the
birds were singing in all the trees. On the road
he met a Minute-Man who was hurrying in the
opposite direction, and asked him the news.</p>

<p>“Regulars fired on our boys at Lexin’ton,”
replied the fellow as he hurried past. Over his
shoulder he shouted, “Killed six of ’em—war’s
begun!”</p>

<p>Don said not a word in reply, but stood stock
still in the road. For some reason a great lump
had come into his throat, and he thought of his
Aunt Martha. He must get to her as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p>As he came near the North Bridge he saw the
Provincial troops—the Minute-Men and the
militia of the town and detachments of Minute-Men
from some of the outlying towns; and all the
while fresh soldiers were hurrying to swell the
numbers. The British, he soon learned, were on
their way to Concord, and several companies of
Provincials had gone out to meet them.</p>

<p>Don left the town and struck off into the open
country several hundred yards from the Lexington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
road. After a few minutes of rapid walking
he saw the detachment of Americans coming
back. He quickened his pace and finally broke
into a run.</p>

<p>He had gone something more than a mile and a
half when he suddenly stopped and threw himself
on the ground. There on the road, marching
steadily in the direction of Concord, was a large
force of regulars. He could see the flash of
metal and the bright red of their coats. For a
while he lay there, panting. Then at last, spying
a great rock with a hollow just behind it, he
crept toward it and waited.</p>

<p>The long column advanced slowly. Now Don
could hear the crunch of their feet on the hard
road. He lifted his head cautiously and began
to count; there must easily be a thousand Redcoats.
The crunching grew louder as the head
of the column came almost opposite to him.
Now he could hear the rattle of equipment and
the occasional jangling of a sword.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="facing072">
  <img class="w100" src="images/facing072.jpg" alt="He Lifted His Head Cautiously and Began to Count">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">He Lifted His Head Cautiously and Began to Count.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was some time before the rear of the column
had passed. He waited until it was perhaps a
quarter of a mile up the road and then got to
his feet. He ought not to have much trouble
in reaching Boston if he started at once. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
was about to resume his journey when a fresh
thought came to him. Ought he to go without
knowing what was to happen to the town of
Concord—and to his Cousin Deborah? For at
least five minutes he struggled with the question.
“No, I oughtn’t!” he declared at last and, turning
suddenly, began to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>It was close to seven o’clock when the regulars,
in two columns, marched into Concord and sent
a party over the North Bridge into the country.
Don found a clump of spruces growing on a hillside
and climbed into the lower branches of one
of them. From that position he could see the
scattered houses and the two bridges, though the
distance was too great for him to be able to
distinguish features or even the outlines of anybody
in the town.</p>

<p>Part of the King’s force seemed to have disbanded,
and later when Don heard the ring of
axes he suspected that they were destroying the
stores that had not been carried away. “Well,”
he thought, “they won’t be able to destroy
much.”</p>

<p>But when he distinguished blue smoke curling
upward from several places near the centre of the
town he almost lost his grip on the branch to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
which he was clinging. One of them was the
court-house! Where was the militia? Where
were the Minute-Men? He made out the peaked
roof of his cousin’s house and the great elm standing
beside it, and observed with some satisfaction
that no Redcoats were close to it. Then a while
later he saw the thread of smoke above the court-house
grow thinner, and at last it disappeared
altogether.</p>

<p>Don held his position in the tree for more than
an hour. He ground his teeth as he saw a detachment
of soldiers leave the town and cut down
the liberty pole on the side of the hill. Where
were the Minute-Men and the militia?</p>

<p>The main body of the regulars was well inside
the town. At the South Bridge there was a
small party on guard, and at the North Bridge
was another party of about one hundred. Don
was so much occupied with watching the Redcoats
that he had failed to observe a long double
column of Provincials coming down the hill beyond
the North Bridge; they were moving at a
fast walk and carried their guns at the trail.</p>

<p>At first glance he thought there were no more
than a hundred of them, but as he watched he was
forced to conclude that there were at least three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
hundred. He pulled himself farther out on the
limb and waited.</p>

<p>The detachment of regulars, who were on the
far side of the bridge, hastily retired across it and
prepared for an attack. When the Provincials
were a few rods distant the Redcoats opened fire,
then waited and fired again, and Don saw two
men fall. Then he saw a succession of bright
flashes and heard the crash of arms as the Provincials
returned the fire. Several of the enemy
fell. Then there was more firing, and in a
few minutes the British left the bridge and ran
in great haste toward the main body, a detachment
from which was on the way to meet them.
The Provincials pursued the regulars over the
bridge and then divided; one party climbed the
hill to the east, and the other returned to the
high grounds.</p>

<p>Don found himself trembling all over; he felt
sick and dizzy. With much difficulty he reached
the ground, where he lay for a few minutes. On
getting to his feet, he saw the Redcoats who had
first crossed the North Bridge returning. In the
town there seemed to be much confusion; the sun
glanced on red coats and polished trimmings as
men hurried here and there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>Don would not trust himself to climb the tree
again, but threw himself on the ground at the
foot of it. He would rest for a while and then
set out on his long journey back to Boston, fairly
confident that his cousin had not been harmed.
He had not slept a wink since some time between
one and two o’clock in the morning; now it was
after ten o’clock. So when his head began to
nod he did not try very hard to fight off sleep.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>ACROSS THE FLATS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Don</span> was wakened by the sound of firing. He
sat up and rubbed his eyes; then, looking at the
sun, he guessed that twelve o’clock had passed.
He could see nothing of the Redcoats; nor could
he see smoke anywhere inside the town. From
the east came the sound of firing that had
wakened him, and men with muskets were hurrying
across fields in that direction. For a moment
he thought of returning to his Cousin Deborah’s;
then he decided to push for Boston as fast as he
could.</p>

<p>Half running, half walking, he made his way
in a southeasterly direction in order to avoid the
main road. Once he wondered whether the Redcoat
Harry Hawkins was with this expedition of
British troops, but somehow the thought was
painful, and he turned his mind to other things.</p>

<p>For some time he had been climbing a rocky
hillside; now, on reaching the crest, he got his
last glimpse of the skirmish. The British were
in the road just outside of Lexington, and, far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
off as Don was, he could see plainly that they
were having a hard time of it. He could see
the flash of sabres as if the officers were urging
their men to advance. One officer was prancing
here and there on a spirited black horse, as if he
had lost control of the animal. Then Don saw
part of the King’s troops open fire and saw a
dozen or more muskets flash in reply along an old
stone wall on the opposite side of the road. Before
he heard the reports of them he saw the black
horse fall. Another glance and he saw a company
of Minute-Men crossing a distant field at
a rapid pace. The sight of a battle going on
almost under his nose, the sound of guns, the
smell of powder, all seemed to hold him spell-bound,
and only the thought of his Aunt Martha
alone in the little house in Pudding Lane caused
him to turn and hurry on his way.</p>

<p>Soon he was out of hearing of the firing, but
from time to time he saw detachments of Minute-Men
and militia marching to the east. Once he
stopped at a solitary farmhouse and asked for
something to eat. A woman who was alone except
for a little girl of nine or ten years gave him
bread and cheese and then prepared a small
bundle of the food for him to take along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Don told her what he had seen at Concord and
at Lexington, and her lips quivered; but she
smiled at him. “Such a day!” she exclaimed.
“My husband and my three brothers have gone.
It seems that all the men from the village have
gone. I have heard that the town of Dedham is
almost empty; even the company of gray-haired
old veterans of the French Wars has gone. Such
a day! Be careful, my boy, and return to your
aunt as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>Don thanked her for her kindness as he was
leaving the house, and soon he was hurrying on
his way toward Boston. From Glen Drake he
had learned many of the secrets of woodcraft and
had little trouble in making his way through the
thickets in the vicinity of Fresh Pond. But
mishaps will sometimes overtake the best of
woodsmen. As Don was descending a slope on
the western side of the pond he stepped on a
loose stone, which turned under his weight and
sent him crashing headlong to the bottom. He
lay there with teeth set and both hands clenched;
a sharp pain was throbbing and pounding in his
right ankle. Little drops of perspiration stood
out like beads on his forehead.</p>

<p>For several minutes he lay there; then as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
pain decreased in violence he sat up. But later
when he rose he found that he dared not put any
weight at all on his right foot. Here was a
predicament! There was not a house in sight;
he was a long way from the nearest road; and
night was coming on.</p>

<p>He tried to climb the slope down which he had
slid, but the effort only sent sharp pains shooting
up his leg. Even when he crawled for only a
dozen yards or so on his hands and knees the
pain would force him to stop; it seemed that he
could not move without giving the ankle a painful
wrench. Several times he shouted for help,
but he had little hope that anybody would be in
that vicinity to hear him. So at last he dragged
himself to a little cove that was overgrown with
birches and willows; there he loosened his shoe
and rubbed his swollen ankle.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said to himself, “I’ve got to stay
here all night, and I haven’t a thing except my
knife and——” He interrupted himself with an
exclamation; his knife was not in his pocket.
Then he remembered that he had left it at his
Cousin Deborah’s.</p>

<p>The missing knife made his situation even more
desperate than he had supposed it was. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
a knife he might have fashioned a bow such as
he had once seen Glen Drake use for lighting a
fire; as it was, he should have to keep warm as
best he could.</p>

<p>The first thing he did was to choose a convenient
hollow that was protected at the back by
the hill and on the sides by birches and the willows.
Then, breaking off a quantity of branches,
he fashioned a rude but effective windbreak for
the front. By the time he had finished doing
that work it was twilight, and a cool wind was
blowing across the pond.</p>

<p>Don opened the package of food that the good
lady at the farmhouse had given him. There
were bread and cheese and three small ginger
cakes; and when he had eaten half the food and
put the rest by till morning he felt a good deal
better. Pulling his coat up round his neck, he
snuggled down on the light branches with which
he had carpeted the floor of his bower and prepared
to wait for morning.</p>

<p>All light had faded from the sky, and the wind
was rising steadily. Loose twigs all round him
tapped incessantly against one another in tune
with the wind. Don shivered and forgot the dull
pain in his ankle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Out in the pond and down close to the shore on
both sides of the cove he could hear strange little
splashes, and in the thickets behind him a pair of
owls were calling every now and then. If it had
not been for thoughts of Aunt Martha, Don
might really have enjoyed his experience. He
did not doubt that he should be able to walk in
the morning, and he rather liked being out alone
as Glen Drake had been many, many times.</p>

<p>Once he dozed off and awoke some time later,
feeling cold and hungry. The twigs were tapping
all about him; somewhere far to the south
a hound was baying mournfully; and in front of
him the moon had covered the pond with a silvery
sheen.</p>

<p>Again Don dozed off, and then awoke with a
violent start. Somebody—or something—was
moving about in the underbrush on the slope
above him. Then a stone rattled down and
bounded into the water. Startled at the loud
splash it made, Don gave an involuntary exclamation.
An instant later he heard someone call
his name.</p>

<p>“O Don!” the call was repeated.</p>

<p>Don sat up. “Who is it?” he shouted in
reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“Yer safe and sound? Praise be for that!”</p>

<p>“Glen!” cried Don, pulling himself upward.</p>

<p>In a moment the old trapper was at the foot
of the slope, and Don was explaining the accident
that had befallen him.</p>

<p>“Well, yer a plucky lad,” said Glen. “I
tracked ye all the way from Concord, and when
I found you was headin’ fer Fresh Pond I began
to have my fears. Here, now, let me take ye on
my back, and we’ll talk as we go along.”</p>

<p>Don was a sturdy boy and unusually solid for
his age, but Glen Drake lifted him to his back as
if he had been no more than a child; Don could
feel the muscles in the old trapper’s shoulders
play up and down as Glen climbed the slope
easily and walked quite as well as if it had been
daylight.</p>

<p>“What happened to the Redcoats, Glen?”
asked Don.</p>

<p>“They got licked,” Glen replied promptly.
“They ran most all the way from Lexin’ton, and
some of ’em fell and lay still with their tongues
a-hanging out; they were that tired. They lost
a lot of men, Don, and serves ’em right. Our
boys kept a-coming from all directions—and most
of ’em know how to shoot too! I tell you, if a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
second force of the King’s men hadn’t come out,
not one of the Redcoats that tried to burn Concord
would have got back alive. Now they’re
sewed up tight in Boston; we’ve got an army
watchin’ the town, and it’s growing every minute.”</p>

<p>“How’s Aunt Martha, and how am I ever
going to get back to her?”</p>

<p>“Your Aunt Martha is all right—at least,
she was the last I saw her. As to how you’re
a-goin’ to get back, I can’t say for certain. But
I’ll get you back somehow; you trust me for
that.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Uncle David?”</p>

<p>“He’s at Cambridge with the army. I’m sort
of with the army myself, though I don’t guess I’ll
ever do much drillin’.” Glen Drake chuckled.
“Morning’s a-coming, Don; morning’s a-coming,
and we’re at war!”</p>

<p>Don thought of his Aunt Martha, alone in
Pudding Lane.</p>

<p>All the while Glen had been tramping with
long strides in the direction of the main part of
Cambridge. Only once did he pause, and then
it was to fill his pipe. At last he turned into a
lane at the right of the road and approached a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
small house that overlooked the river. By that
time dawn was well on the way.</p>

<p>Don observed two or three soldiers at the side
of the house; they were cooking bacon over a
small fire. “Hi, there!” shouted one. “I see
you found your boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I found him,” replied Glen. “Where’s
Dave Hollis?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t come in yet.”</p>

<p>Glen carried Don into the house, spoke a few
words to a woman who was preparing the morning
meal and then, at her bidding, climbed the
stairs.</p>

<p>By the time the rays of the sun were slanting
down on the river Don was asleep deep within
the feathery softness of a huge four-posted bed.
The woman down-stairs had given him a delicious
breakfast, and after he had eaten it the old
trapper had rubbed his injured ankle with
some potent, vile-smelling ointment that he said
would cure anything from rheumatism to nose-bleed.</p>

<p>Near the middle of the afternoon Don awoke
and a little to his astonishment saw his Uncle
David sitting beside Glen at one side of the bed.
“Uncle Dave!” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>In a moment David Hollis had clasped his
nephew’s hands in his own. “You’ve had a hard
time, Donald, my boy,” he said. “How do you
feel?”</p>

<p>“All right, except for my ankle; I gave it a
bad twist when I fell.”</p>

<p>“Yes; Glen has told me. I hope you’ll be
able to walk soon.” David Hollis looked at his
nephew anxiously.</p>

<p>“In two or three days maybe,” said the
trapper.</p>

<p>Don groaned. “Not until then?” he asked.
“Meanwhile Aunt Martha is all alone.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and she needs you, Donald.” David
Hollis was plainly worried. “The worst of it
is,” he continued, “that the King’s soldiers have
fortified the Neck and are mighty watchful.
There’s no way of getting in or out.”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong there,” said Glen. “The back
harbor’s dry at low water, you know.”</p>

<p>David Hollis looked doubtful. “It’d be too
great a risk to try and cross that way,” he said.
“If anything should happen, I’d never forgive
myself.”</p>

<p>“Now, listen here,” said Glen; “I promised
the boy I’d get him back, and, by thunder, I’m a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
man of my word. A dark night, a little fog, and
nothing’s easier.”</p>

<p>Don’s uncle said nothing for several minutes.
At last he grasped the old trapper’s hand.
“Glen,” he said, “I’ve never yet known you to
fail in an undertaking. May you succeed in this.
I see no other way.”</p>

<p>The next day was Friday, and thanks to the
trapper’s ointment Don was able to walk a very
little. In the evening his uncle came to talk with
him again. “I probably shan’t see you again
for some time,” he said. “My company is leaving
Cambridge. When you see your Aunt
Martha I want you to say this to her: tell her
first of all that I’m safe and well and that she
needn’t worry. Second, tell her that at the first
opportunity I want her to leave the town; it’s
the height of folly to remain. And, Donald”—David
Hollis spoke in a low voice,—“tell her I
love her. And now, my boy, good-bye, and God
bless you!”</p>

<p>That was the last that Don saw of his uncle
for many, many weeks. The next day he and
the trapper went for a short walk among the
narrow, twisting streets of the town. Soldiers
were quartered in many of the houses, and people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
were talking of others that were soon to arrive.
One man remarked that as a result of the British
attack on Concord and Lexington an army of
twenty thousand Provincials had arisen almost
overnight. There was much brave talk of attacking
the King’s troops in Boston and of driving
them headlong into the sea.</p>

<p>By Tuesday, Don’s ankle was strong again,
but he had to walk with great care. Then early
one foggy morning Glen Drake announced that
the time had come to cross the flats.</p>

<p>The two had a hot supper together down in
the kitchen, and an hour or so later they started
toward the river.</p>

<p>Glen led the way and in spite of the heavy fog
and the darkness stepped boldly yet as silently
as a cat. They had gone beyond the last fringe
of dwelling houses when the trapper put the end
of a buckskin thong into Don’s hand. “Keep
tight hold,” he whispered, “and don’t talk.”</p>

<p>Don thought he had never seen a blacker
night—blackness and fog overhead, blackness
and fog all round them, with here and there a
dim yellow light. Several times, at the sound of
footsteps, Glen paused to let a Provincial sentry
pass unseen ahead of them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Once they turned sharply to the left and
walked for almost half an hour over uneven
grassy land. Then they turned to the right, and
soon Don felt his feet sink into cool mud. Glen
put his mouth close to the boy’s ear and
whispered, “How’s the ankle?”</p>

<p>“All right, Glen,” Don replied softly.</p>

<p>They pressed forward slowly. Sometimes
reeds and cattails swept against their hands;
sometimes they seemed to be walking on firm
sand. The fog, cold and oppressive, was blowing
in from the east and seemed to deaden all
sounds, even the quash, quash of their feet. Don’s
fingers were like ice as he clung to the thong.
He had no idea in what direction he was going,
but he had confidence in his sturdy guide. Then
a bell tolled somewhere ahead, and a few minutes
later he heard a horse neigh loudly.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour passed, then half an hour.
Finally they were among more cattails. Glen
led the way cautiously among them and at last
climbed a gentle slope. They had reached the
Boston side.</p>

<p>They were making their way upward, when a
stick cracked close at hand, and a sharp voice
rang out: “Halt! Who’s there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Don felt Glen’s arm go around his shoulders,
and in a twinkling the two were flat on their
faces.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” came the voice of the sentry
again.</p>

<p>Don felt his heart pounding at his ribs and the
trapper’s great arm pressing downward on him
like a heavy weight. He heard the sentry advance
and knew that Glen had reached into his
belt for something.</p>

<p>Crunch, crunch sounded the footsteps, each
louder than the last one. Glen had drawn back
his arm and was gathering himself for a spring,
when the footsteps ceased. A moment later the
two heard them begin again, but now they were
growing fainter and fainter.</p>

<p>Glen got softly to his feet and pulled Don
upward. Together they hurried forward and did
not stop till they reached a clump of trees by the
side of what appeared to be a path.</p>

<p>“Do you know where you are?” whispered
Glen.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Don.</p>

<p>“Well, this is Cambridge Street. You’ll have
to follow it alone. Go carefully, and if you meet
anyone—well, don’t let ’em see you; that’ll be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
best. And now, good-bye, Don. Take good
care of your Aunt Martha.”</p>

<p>They shook hands in the darkness, and a moment
later Don was alone.</p>

<small>JUD APPLETON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Luck</span> seemed to walk hand in hand with Don
after Glen Drake had vanished into the darkness.
The boy set out at once along Cambridge Street,
walking slowly, pausing frequently, and keeping
well at the side of the road, where the shadows
were thickest. When he came within sight of the
first house he stopped to consider, but the sudden
barking of a dog caused him to turn abruptly into
the field at the right. He crossed George Street
and skirted Beacon Hill. Near Valley Acre
he came unexpectedly on a large overhanging
rock with two scrub pines growing in front of it;
the spot was so sheltered and so fragrant and
dry with pine needles that he decided to remain
there till dawn.</p>

<p>Aunt Martha was an early riser, and it was
well that she was, for shortly before six o’clock
the knocker rose and fell heavily three times on
the door. She left her stove and hastened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
answer the knocks. The next moment she was
perhaps the most astonished woman in Boston.
“Why—why, Donald!” she cried, and then
caught her nephew in her arms.</p>

<p>Don had the breath almost crushed from his
body, and the little prepared speech of greeting
that he had had all ready seemed to have fled
from his memory. “Aunt Martha,” he gasped.
“I didn’t know—you were so—so strong!”</p>

<p>“Now,” said his aunt, releasing him at last,
“tell me everything, Donald,—everything!”</p>

<p>Hungry as Don was, he made no mention of
food but sat down in the low white rocker beside
the window and began with the thing that was
most vivid in his mind—the skirmish at Concord.</p>

<p>And all the while that he talked, Aunt Martha
sat pale and rigid in the chair beside him. Only
once were her eyes moist, and that was when Don
gave her the last of his uncle’s three messages;
but she said nothing and merely nodded for him
to continue.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that’s all,” said Don at last.
“You know, Aunt Martha, I’d have been home
long ago except for my ankle.”</p>

<p>“I know, Donald; and I’m thankful, I hope.
It might have been worse. And now let me get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
you something to eat. Oh, Donald, you’ll never
know how glad I am to have you with me again.”</p>

<p>It was a long while before Aunt Martha ceased
to ask questions; and then it was Don’s turn. A
great change, he learned, had come over the town
even in the few days that he had been away from
it. It was in a state of siege, cut off from the
outside world, and food was scarce among the
poor. There were suffering and distress; many
persons, like Aunt Martha, had relatives and
friends in the Continental army and thought with
dread and apprehension of what might happen if
the besiegers should attack.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s to become of us, truly I
don’t,” said Aunt Martha. “With your uncle
and Glen with the army, it’s most too much to
bear. Fortunately, though, we shall not lack for
food; the store’s well stocked.”</p>

<p>“And that stuff in the cellar, is it still there?”
asked Don.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s likely to remain.”</p>

<p>“We might be able to sell it,” Don suggested
hopefully. Then he added, “If we could only
get it to the army in Cambridge!”</p>

<p>But Aunt Martha only smiled and shook her
head. “Don,” she said, “would you rather be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
in Cambridge, or perhaps with your cousin in
Concord, than here?”</p>

<p>“I want to be with you,” Don replied firmly
and then wondered at the look of quick relief that
came over his aunt’s face.</p>

<p>The next day he learned the reason for it.
General Gage had agreed to allow those families
who wished to leave the town to go in safety.
But Aunt Martha had not changed her mind.
In spite of the supplications of her husband,
whom she loved dearly, and in spite of the risks
that she ran in remaining, she would not leave
the little house in which she had been born and
had lived most of her life. If she was stubborn,
it was stubbornness of a defiant, heroic sort, and
those who knew her respected her for it, though
some called her a “foolish woman.”</p>

<p>As a result of General Gage’s permission
hundreds of families did leave the town—a circumstance
that greatly alarmed the Tories, who
believed that as long as there were women and
children in the town the Continentals would not
attack. So at last the general withdrew his permission,
and the town settled down to wait and
to watch.</p>

<p>Though there was no longer any school for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
Don to attend he found plenty of things to keep
him busy. He helped his aunt about the store
in the daytime and sat and talked with her at
night. And the conversation always was of his
uncle and of Glen Drake and the army, of which
they knew little enough. Then always before
they went to bed Aunt Martha would spread the
old thumb-worn Bible on her knees and read a
chapter aloud.</p>

<p>Frequently of an afternoon Don would take
Sailor and go for a long walk as he used to do.
One bright warm day early in May the two were
on their way home from a long jaunt, and were
walking along between the elms on Common
Street, when Don observed a group of Redcoats
some distance in front of him. “Here, Sailor,”
he called, but the terrier paid no heed and ran
on ahead.</p>

<p>When Don was within a few yards of the
group he recognized two familiar figures—Tom
Bullard, who as aide to General Ruggles of the
Tories, now wore a white sash round his left
sleeve, and Harry Hawkins, the Redcoat, whose
life Don had saved. The two were laughing and
talking together.</p>

<p>“Here’s one of the young rebels,” cried Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
as Don drew near. “And here’s his rebel dog.
Get out of here, you pup.”</p>

<p>Don made no answer but spoke sharply to
Sailor, and the dog trotted to his side.</p>

<p>“Good day to you, young sire,” said Hawkins
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Good day,” replied Don, and then colored as
he observed a boy of perhaps his own age who
happened to be passing with a fishing pole over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Do you know him, Hawkins?” inquired Tom
in astonishment and then as Sailor left Don’s
side and started back toward the group he added
angrily: “Git, you pup, git!”</p>

<p>But Sailor was all friendliness as he trotted
toward the soldiers.</p>

<p>“Come here, Sailor!” ordered Don, stopping
and snapping his fingers.</p>

<p>But at that instant Tom’s foot shot out and,
striking the terrier in the chest, lifted him into
the air. With a loud yelp the dog landed on his
back and then, scrambling to his feet, ran to Don
and stood beside him, trembling.</p>

<p>“I’ll learn a rebel dog a trick or two,” cried
Tom. “And before long——”</p>

<p>But Tom never finished the sentence. Before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Don could take more than two steps forward,
and before any of the soldiers could interfere, the
boy whom Don had just passed dropped his
fishing pole, and, lowering his head, rushed at
Tom. One of his fists struck the Tory squarely
in the mouth and sent him reeling; the other
struck him on the ear and sent him crashing to
the ground.</p>

<p>Tom was a big boy and very active. In a
moment he was on his feet and had closed with
his opponent, who was easily twenty pounds the
lighter.</p>

<p>“Fight!” cried a Redcoat. “Clear the way
there!”</p>

<p>But there was no fight; at least it lasted only
until Harry Hawkins could spring forward and
pull the two apart. “Stop it!” he cried and
pushed Tom’s assailant away. “And you,” he
said sharply to Tom, “get along and be quick
about it! I thought better than that of you!”</p>

<p>“Why, Hawkins——”</p>

<p>“Never mind that; you deserve a licking, and
if the boy hadn’t been smaller than you, I’d have
stood and watched you take it. Kick a dog!
You ought to be kicked, yourself!”</p>

<p>Tom Bullard’s mouth opened and closed. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
gulped several times and then turned for sympathy
to the other soldiers; but they were laughing
at him. With low mutterings he picked up
his hat and strode abruptly off across the Common.
The soldiers, still laughing, started toward
the tented area.</p>

<p>Don gathered Sailor in his arms and walked
to where the boy was standing; he had shouldered
his fishing pole and was blowing on the knuckles
of his right hand.</p>

<p>He was a boy very much like Don in general
appearance—sturdy, active and alert-looking.
His hair was of a reddish brown, and his eyes,
dark and sparkling, seemed to flash with little
points of fire. As Don approached him, a smile
played about the corners of his rather large
mouth.</p>

<p>Don extended his hand, and the boy grasped
it. “I want to thank you,” said Don, “for
thrashing Tom Bullard. My name is Donald
Alden; I live in Pudding Lane.”</p>

<p>The boy grinned. “Mine’s Jud Appleton.”
He patted the head of the terrier. “Nice looking
dog you have. When that big Tory kicked
him I couldn’t help sailing into him. He’d have
licked me, though, if it hadn’t been for the Redcoat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
My, but didn’t he talk hot to him afterward!”</p>

<p>The two boys laughed heartily. “You surely
hit him hard,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Did I?” said Jud. “Well, not hard enough,
I reckon. Anybody who’d kick a dog—my, how
I hate ’em! I hate Redcoats too, and Tories
worse—and when a Tory kicks a dog I just boil
over.”</p>

<p>The boy’s eyes were flashing again, and his
fists were tightly clenched. Don felt an instant
liking for him.</p>

<p>“Say,” said Jud quickly, “do you know that
Redcoat? I saw him speak to you.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” Don replied and colored again.
“You see, I—I saved him from drowning once.”</p>

<p>“From drowning!”</p>

<p>“Yes; that is—it was before Concord.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see.” Jud seemed somewhat relieved.
“Do you know the Tory?”</p>

<p>“We used to be good friends once. His name
is Tom Bullard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; so you said. Say, come on along
home with me, won’t you? I live just down here
in Hog Alley. I’ve got the finest bunch of
kittens you ever saw.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“You like kittens?”</p>

<p>“I like all kinds of animals,” Jud replied
gravely.</p>

<p>That was enough for Don, and he accompanied
his new friend past West Street and along toward
the alley.</p>

<p>“It’s no fun, living so close to the Common
these days,” said Jud. “All you see is Redcoats.
And how I hate ’em! My father and my two
brothers are in the army, and I only wish I could
be there too. A drummer boy is what I’d like
to be.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” replied Don. “I was up at
Concord and saw the fight——”</p>

<p>“Did you!” cried Jud. “Tell me about it.
And how did you ever get back?”</p>

<p>By the time Don had told him something of
the skirmish and of Glen Drake and his Uncle
David the two boys were at Jud’s house. A
poor, miserable-looking, one-story little place it
was, with a cracked weather-worn door and a
window on either side that looked out across the
road on a large triangular field covered with
clover and dandelions.</p>

<p>“That’s our cow over there,” said Jud, “and
those are our chickens. We had twenty-six, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
we lost four the other night. Ma thinks a skunk
got ’em, but I think it was Redcoats.”</p>

<p>He led the way to a shed behind the house, and
a moment later Don was looking at six fluffy
black and white kittens nestled in the folds of a
burlap bag. As he bent over them the mother
cat came running from a corner of the shed, and
he started backward. Sailor backed away and
sat down; he had suffered enough for one day.</p>

<p>“She won’t hurt you,” said Jud, laughing.
“Will you, puss?” He played with the kittens
for several minutes, stroking and calling each by
name while the mother cat sat by and watched
contentedly. “They’re pretty well grown now
and about ready to shift for themselves. That’s
a good dog of yours to sit there like that. I had
a hard time to keep my dog away from them at
first. Say, wouldn’t you like to have one? Ma
says I can’t keep ’em all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I would,” replied Don. “We haven’t
any, and a cat might be good company for my
aunt.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s a nice one,” and Jud lifted one
of the kittens that was all black except for one
white foot. “See, she has one white shoe on; she
lost the others.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“I’ll call it Whitefoot, then,” said Don and
laughed.</p>

<p>“Judson, are you home?” came a woman’s
voice from the house.</p>

<p>“Just got home, Ma.”</p>

<p>“Well, come here; we lost two more chickens
last night.”</p>

<p>“Thunder!” exclaimed Jud in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, two more,” repeated Mrs. Appleton,
appearing at the door of the shed. “I counted
them just now, and there’s only twenty. Oh!”
she exclaimed at sight of Don.</p>

<p>“This is Don Alden,” said Jud; “he lives up
in Puddin’ Lane.”</p>

<p>Don found Jud’s mother a pleasant, talkative
little woman who in some ways reminded him of
his aunt, though she was not so old. When Jud
had explained to her about their adventure with
Tom Bullard and about Don’s trip to Concord
she insisted that he stay and have something to
eat with them.</p>

<p>Later as Don was about to set out with his new
pet, Jud whispered to him: “I’m going to stay
up to-night and catch that chicken-thief. I wish
you could be here with me. Can’t you come
back?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“I don’t know,” Don replied doubtfully.
“I’d like to, but there’s my aunt, you know; I
don’t like to leave her alone. Have you got a
gun or anything?”</p>

<p>“No; but I’ve got a hickory club, and I can
throw a stone pretty straight.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to sit up with you,” said Don.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>THE BOYS SET A TRAP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day was fair and warm, but on the
following day the wind changed, and the drab,
suffering town of Boston was shrouded in a thick
blanket of fog. Don rolled over in bed and
stretched and yawned.</p>

<p>“Donald,” came the voice of his aunt, “it’s
high time you were down here to breakfast.
You’re awake, ’cause I hear the bed a-creaking.
Come on now; Mrs. Lancaster is coming to-day.”</p>

<p>Don lay and blinked for a moment; then he
sprang out of bed. If Mrs. Lancaster were
coming, probably she would stay all night—she
usually did. Don had almost given up hope of
going to Jud’s and of sitting up with him to
catch the skunk or whatever was stealing his
chickens; but now, if Mrs. Lancaster were coming,
he would not mind leaving his aunt for a
while in the evening.</p>

<p>At breakfast Aunt Martha said that her visitor
would remain overnight; and when Don had told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
her what he wanted to do she objected at first, as
he knew she would, and then consented after he
had promised her to keep far away from any
skunk that might come after Jud’s chickens.</p>

<p>At evening when Don set out for Hog Alley
the fog was still heavy. The houses on the opposite
side of Pudding Lane, which was one of
the narrowest streets in town, could hardly be
seen. And on the Common even the scarlet-coated
soldiers were almost invisible at a distance
of twenty yards.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but what Ma was right,” said
Jud when Don reached the shabby little house in
Hog Alley. “There was a skunk round here
last night—a big fellow too, from the smell of
him. But I had the hen-house locked tight and
all the chickens inside; so he didn’t get a one. I
was wishing you’d been here though—are you
going to stay to-night?”</p>

<p>“For a while, if you want me.”</p>

<p>“I surely do!” Jud was very positive about it.
There was no doubt that, even on such short
acquaintance, he liked Don quite as well as Don
liked him. “Well, I’ve got a plan,” he said
eagerly. “I want you to tell me what you think
of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Let’s hear it,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Well, come around to the chicken yard and
I’ll explain,” said Jud. “Now here,” he said a
few moments later, “you see our chicken yard
has a high fence and a small gate at the far
end.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Don; “the gate opens out and
latches on the outside.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s a strong latch too. Well, I
thought we could leave the gate open and attach
a long rope to it and run it through the fence
on this side and back to the wagon shed here,
where you and I could wait. Then if Mr. Skunk
comes along and enters the yard, all we’ll have
to do is to pull the gate shut and we’ll have him.
Of course he won’t be able to hurt the chicks
’cause they’ll be locked tight in the hen-house.
What do you think of the idea, Don?”</p>

<p>“Mighty good; but what’ll we do with the
skunk when we catch it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Fred Ferguson next door will kill it for
us in the morning.”</p>

<p>“And what if it shouldn’t be a skunk? What
if it should be a Redcoat?”</p>

<p>Jud laughed. “I guess we shan’t catch a Redcoat,”
he replied. “I hate ’em so much I guess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
I was unfair the other day. It’s a skunk all
right; you’ll see.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Don. “We’d be in a nice
fix if we caught a Redcoat.”</p>

<p>“Let’s set our trap,” said Jud. “The first
thing is to find enough rope.”</p>

<p>The boys at once began to search the wagon
shed, and by the time they had found enough
lengths, had fastened them to one another and
had tied one end of the improvised rope to the
gate of the chicken yard, darkness had set in in
earnest. Carrying the other end of the rope
across the yard and passing it between the wires
of the fence, they retired with it to the door of
the wagon shed to wait.</p>

<p>“Just a moment,” said Jud and crossed the
yard to the house.</p>

<p>When he returned he carried with him a pan of
cornbread and two large apples. “This is going
to be fun,” he said. “It’s like being out in the
woods, trapping.”</p>

<p>“It is a little,” Don agreed; and then he told
Jud more about Glen Drake and about the trips
that the old trapper and he had made together.
“You’ll have to come to the house sometime
when he’s there,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“I’d like to,” said Jud, “but if he’s with the
army, it’ll be a long time before he can come to
Boston again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” replied Don. “If Glen
wanted to come very much he’d come, and the
King’s men would never catch him either!”</p>

<p>For a while the boys sat silent, munching cornbread
and apples in the doorway of the old shed.
All round them was darkness, damp and chill.
Up on Common Street a wagon creaked past;
the driver, whoever he was, was singing a boisterous
song. After a while he passed out of hearing;
and only the occasional challenge of a sentry
far across the Common broke the stillness.</p>

<p>Don’s head was beginning to nod; but Jud,
rope in hand, was wide awake. “Not asleep,
are you, Don?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“What? Oh, yes.” Don shook his head from
side to side several times. “Guess I was asleep.
Wonder what time it is?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know; I’ve been listening for a bell.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do to fall asleep,” muttered Don.</p>

<p>But in a few minutes his head was on his chest,
and his shoulder was resting comfortably against
the side of the doorway.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed, and at the end of it Jud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
was nodding between sleep and wakefulness.
Suddenly he felt a slight tug on the rope in his
hands. With a start he sat bolt upright, and the
next instant the chickens in the hen-house began
to cackle furiously.</p>

<p>“Don! Don!” whispered Jud and seized his
friend by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“What!” Don was wide awake in a flash.</p>

<p>But before Jud could reply something struck
the fence. Jud gave a mighty heave on the rope,
and as the gate came shut with a harsh bang both
boys heard someone exclaim aloud.</p>

<p>“A Redcoat!” gasped Jud. “What shall we
do?”</p>

<p>“Quick, call somebody!” cried Don, springing
to his feet.</p>

<p>Both boys raised their voices and then rushed
toward the house. The chickens were making a
terrible noise now; and Jud’s dog, which he had
tied at the back of the wagon shed, was barking
at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>Whoever was in the chicken yard was having a
hard time getting out. Don, standing at the corner
of the house, could hear the fellow pounding
furiously at the gate and shaking it with all his
might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>In the midst of the commotion a window
opened in the house next door, and then a light
gleamed within. “There’s Fred Ferguson,”
said Jud. “O Fred, O Fred!” he shouted.
“Come quick!”</p>

<p>“Judson, Judson, what on earth is the matter?”
It was the voice of Mrs. Appleton.</p>

<p>Jud did not reply, for at that moment Fred
Ferguson, partly dressed and carrying a lighted
candle, which he was shading with his hand, appeared
on the back doorstep of the Ferguson
house. He was a big raw-boned young fellow,
and both boys noticed that he was carrying
a heavy stick under one arm. “What’s
wrong?” he shouted and advanced toward the
fence.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s in our chicken yard,” replied
Jud. “Come on, Don,” he added, and the boys
hurried toward Fred.</p>

<p>“Open the gate and let me out of this!” came
a voice out of the fog, and Don started.</p>

<p>The fence shook violently, and the dog and the
chickens increased their clamor.</p>

<p>“Open the gate, I say!”</p>

<p>“Leave off shaking that fence,” cried Fred.
“Who are you, and what are you doing in there?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Leave off shaking that gate, I tell you—if you
break it, I’ll whale ye!”</p>

<p>“Open up, then!”</p>

<p>“Come here, you boys, and tell me who
it is,” said Fred and held the candle above his
head.</p>

<p>Both boys got a brief glimpse of the person
within the yard, and Jud said quickly, “’Tain’t a
Redcoat.”</p>

<p>“No; ’tain’t a Redcoat,” said Fred. “Now
come here,” he said in a loud voice. “Come here
and let me see ye, and tell me what you’re a-doing
in there.”</p>

<p>“Open that gate and stand aside—or—or, by
thunder, I’ll shoot!”</p>

<p>“Judson! Come here!” cried his mother from
the doorway. “Donald, you too!”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, and then Fred
said evenly: “I’ll risk a shot from a chicken-thief.”</p>

<p>With those words he unlatched the gate and
threw it open. “Now come here and let’s see
what kind of a person ye are,” he said and waited
with club poised in one hand.</p>

<p>“Let me hold the candle,” said Don.</p>

<p>He was advancing to take it when the fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
in the yard made a sudden rush. Don saw Fred’s
club descend and heard it strike something hard.
Then Fred went over backward, but just before
the candle went out Don had a glimpse of the
intruder’s face as the fellow rushed past and
vanished into the darkness. It was Tom Bullard!</p>

<p>“Tarnation!” exclaimed Fred, getting to his
feet. “Can’t see a thing. He’s gone, blast
him! What a tormented fool I was to let him
rush me like that!”</p>

<p>The quick footsteps of the thief were becoming
fainter and fainter in the distance. Then they
ceased abruptly.</p>

<p>“Who was it, Fred?” asked Jud.</p>

<p>“Don’t know.” Fred was angry with himself
and spoke sharply. “Didn’t get much of a look
at him and wouldn’t know him again if I saw him.
Well, he won’t come back; that’s certain.”</p>

<p>“Judson, didn’t I call you?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m. Don, where are you? Come into
the house for a minute.”</p>

<p>“No; I’d best be going,” replied Don quickly.</p>

<p>But before he went he whispered to Jud: “Do
you know who the fellow was? It was Tom Bullard!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“Tom Bullard! The fellow who kicked your
dog?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’m sure of it; I saw his face just before
the candle went out.”</p>

<p>Jud whistled softly.</p>

<p>“Judson Greenleaf Appleton, if you don’t
come into the house right straight this minute——”</p>

<p>“Good night, Jud,” said Don and hurried out
into the alley.</p>

<p>A bell was striking the hour of ten o’clock as
Don reached Marlborough Street. Almost no
one was abroad at that late hour, and only here
and there a light gleamed soft and yellow through
the heavy fog. He passed the Old South Meeting-House
and a few minutes later was in Pudding
Lane.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lancaster and Aunt Martha were just
preparing to go to bed, when Don entered, out
of breath and red of face.</p>

<p>“Well, Donald,” said his aunt, “I was thinking
it was high time you returned.”</p>

<p>“Did you catch your skunk?” inquired Mrs.
Lancaster.</p>

<p>Don could not help grinning. “Well, yes; I
guess we did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“You guess!” Aunt Martha was mildly
astonished. “Just what do you mean, Donald?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a real skunk that was after Jud
Appleton’s chickens,” Don replied. “It was
Tom Bullard.”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” exclaimed both ladies.</p>

<p>And Don hastened to explain what had happened
while he was gone.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t I just a-saying,” said Mrs. Lancaster
when Don had finished, “wasn’t I just a-saying,
Martha, that you can’t trust a Tory out of your
sight? Wasn’t I, now?”</p>

<p>“You were, Hannah.”</p>

<p>“And Tom Bullard—well, I always said he
was a bad one.”</p>

<p>And Don was thinking the same thing as he
climbed the stairs to bed a few minutes later.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE REGULARS EMBARK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> the next morning Don was hard at
work washing the windows at the front of the
store. He had cleaned them on the inside and
was about to start on the outside, when Jud
crossed the square and hailed him. Over his
shoulder he was carrying two fishing poles.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Up to the mill-pond. I thought maybe
you’d come along, so I brought an extra pole.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Don; “but I’ll have to finish
these windows first.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you,” Jud replied promptly and,
setting down the poles, rolled up his sleeves.</p>

<p>While the two boys were cleaning and polishing
the glass Tom Bullard happened to turn into
the lane from King Street. It was clear that he
had not expected to meet the boys and did not
want them to see him; for he had no sooner spied
them than he stopped and made as if to turn
back; but Jud’s sharp eyes had already caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
sight of him. “Here’s the chicken-thief, Don,”
he whispered.</p>

<p>Don stopped work to look. It is to Tom’s
credit perhaps that he did not turn on his heel
then and there. What he did was to lift his chin
a trifle and, choosing the opposite side of the
street, march past without looking either to the
right or to the left. It was really a hard thing to
do, for Don and Jud were staring at him and
grinning frankly.</p>

<p>“He’s got his head pretty high, hasn’t he?”
said Jud in a loud whisper.</p>

<p>“But not high enough to hide that bump
above his left eye,” replied Don.</p>

<p>“That’s where Fred’s stick landed,” said Jud.
“Just look how high he holds his head—just like
a chicken!”</p>

<p>Both boys chuckled, and a moment later they
laughed outright when Tom’s foot struck an
upraised brick, and he stumbled. At the corner
of Water Street, Tom turned and shook his fist.</p>

<p>Jud’s eyes flashed, but Don was silent. “And
to think,” he said at last, “that he used to be
my best friend!”</p>

<p>“He’s not worth thinking about,” said Jud
shortly. “Come on, Don, let’s finish these windows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
in a hurry. I wonder how the fish are
biting?”</p>

<p>But there were other things beside fish to
wonder about on that day in early May. The
people of Boston knew little enough of what was
going on round them. Every other person was
wondering how soon the American army would
attack the British, and whether the Redcoats
would risk going out and fighting in the open.
Already there had been skirmishes and they continued
to occur off and on throughout the rest of
the month; but although the Americans were
generally successful, the skirmishes really did not
amount to much.</p>

<p>Word had somehow seeped into the beleaguered
town that the Continental force consisted of sixteen
thousand men and that fortifications were
being prepared in Cambridge and along the
Mystic River; and it was whispered that men
from all the other Colonies as far south as Virginia
were flocking to join the army. But
Gage’s men scoffed at such reports; and although
none of them dared venture outside the town they
also scoffed at the idea that they were in a state
of siege. A body of undisciplined farmers oppose
them, the King’s soldiers? Preposterous!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>What the King’s men did not realize was that
many of them, especially the officers, had fought
in the French wars. Oddly enough the terrible
experience of the nineteenth of April was lost
upon the over-confident British; they supposed
that the men who had fought so valiantly at
Concord and Lexington would run like frightened
sheep in an encounter in the open.</p>

<p>Numerous things had occurred to exasperate
the good people of Boston, but one of the worst
was a proclamation that Gage issued; it declared
martial law and referred to all who were bearing
arms against the King’s men as “rebels and
traitors”; but, said the proclamation, if they
would lay down their arms all would be pardoned—all,
that is, except John Hancock and Samuel
Adams.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the month British re-enforcements
began to arrive, and on the twenty-fifth
the troop-ship <i>Cerebus</i> brought three generals—Howe,
Clinton and Burgoyne.</p>

<p>Don and Jud were in the vicinity of the Green
Dragon Tavern a few days after the <i>Cerebus</i>
arrived. They were looking out over the harbor
when Don heard someone call his name, and,
turning, he saw one of the sailors who had helped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
him from the water the day he had saved the
Redcoat from drowning.</p>

<p>“Hello, there, young Master Donald,” said the
fellow—it was Hank. “There’s the boat out
there that brought the three big ones—Howe,
Clinton and Elbow-Room Burgoyne. If they’d
side-stepped on the gangplank, I don’t doubt
you’d have jumped in and saved them.”</p>

<p>Don flushed. “I’m not so sure—now,” he replied.
“But tell me, why do you call Burgoyne
‘Elbow-Room’?”</p>

<p>“Why, haven’t you heard that story?” Hank
grinned and glanced round to make sure that no
Redcoat was within hearing. “You see, it’s like
this: As the <i>Cerebus</i> was coming in she met a
packet bound for Newport. ‘What news is
there?’ Burgoyne shouts to the skipper. ‘The
town is surrounded by ten thousand country
folk,’ was the reply. At that the general opens
his eyes wide. ‘How many regulars are in the
town?’ he asks. ‘About five thousand,’ the
skipper shouts in reply. Then the general’s eyes
open wider than ever, and he cries, ‘What, ten
thousand peasants keep five thousand King’s
troops shut up! Well, let us get in, and we’ll
soon find elbow-room!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Both boys laughed heartily, and Hank added,
“Elbow-Room Burgoyne it’ll be to the end of
his days, now, I suppose.” Hank lowered his
voice. “Let me tell you something, my lads,”
he said. “There’s going to be a big fight before
many days have passed. There must be close to
ten thousand Redcoats in the town now, and,
mark my words, they’re not going to sit idle, not
they. You lads keep your eyes fixed on Dorchester
Heights and Bunker’s Hill.”</p>

<p>“How do you know all that?” asked Jud.</p>

<p>The sailor solemnly winked his left eye and
stuck his tongue into his left cheek. “The sea-gulls
of the air,” he said. “The sea-gulls of the
air.”</p>

<p>Whether or not Hank had secret information
about the movements and intentions of the British
troops, it is a fact that on the evening of the
sixteenth of June, while Don and his aunt were
sound asleep, events moved swiftly toward a
climax. The army in Cambridge, determined on
driving the King’s troops from the town, took
measures to fortify Bunker Hill, and then almost
at the last moment changed the plan and fortified
a hill that was somewhat nearer the town.
All during the night the Continentals labored at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
throwing up earthworks; and all the while the
stars looked down peacefully, and the British
men-of-war floated serenely with the tide, and
the British patrols cried “All’s well” at frequent
intervals.</p>

<p>At dawn Don and his aunt were wakened by
the noise of firing; but by the time they were both
down to breakfast the firing had ceased.</p>

<p>“Now what in the world could that have
meant?” asked Aunt Martha.</p>

<p>“I’ll find out,” replied Don and ran into the
street.</p>

<p>Near the town hall he inquired of a pedestrian
what the firing was.</p>

<p>“His Majesty’s ship <i>Lively</i>,” replied the fellow
shortly. He was evidently a Tory. “She
fired on some earthworks the rebels have thrown
up over by Charlestown.”</p>

<p>Don waited to hear no more. While he and
his aunt were having breakfast he told her what
he had heard. Aunt Martha only sighed.
“Who knows,” she said after a long pause, “but
what your uncle and Glen are over there at
Charlestown?”</p>

<p>During the forenoon the firing resumed. The
British, it seems, had brought three or four floating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
batteries to bear upon the fortifications; but
in spite of the heavy bombardment the Continentals
continued to work.</p>

<p>The day promised to be hot and sultry. The
sun, a bright ball of molten gold, was blazing
down on the shingled roofs of the town and was
sending up heat waves from the cobblestoned
streets. Don left off his top coat and turned in
the collar of his shirt.</p>

<p>“You don’t look neat and trim, Donald
Alden,” said his aunt as he was about to leave
the house.</p>

<p>“It’s too hot, Aunt Martha.”</p>

<p>“You think so perhaps. Well, don’t go far.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to find Jud,” replied Don.</p>

<p>He did not have to go all the way to Hog Alley
to find his comrade. Jud, hot and excited,
almost ran into him at the foot of School Street.
“O Don!” he exclaimed. “There’s going to be
an awful time—a battle, sure as you’re alive! I
was coming to get you.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Don. “Everybody’s excited.
And did you hear the firing early this morning?”</p>

<p>“Come up to the Common,” said Jud. “The
Redcoats are all on parade. They’re going to
march off, I think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>The boys found the Common a scene of intense
activity. There seemed to be Redcoats everywhere.
Some were in formation; some were
hurrying to join their companies that were assembling,
and all seemed to be carrying arms and full
equipment. The sun flashed on glistening
swords and buckles and seemed to turn each
bright red coat into a vivid blaze of fire. And
overhead the graceful limbs of the great old elms
waved gently to and fro like gigantic lacy green
fans.</p>

<p>“Look,” said Don, “there’s the 43rd, Harry
Hawkins’s regiment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s Hawkins himself,” replied
Jud. “See him—that big fellow?”</p>

<p>Don bit his lips and said nothing. He did not
dare put into words the thoughts that had
come crowding into his mind at sight of the
only Redcoat for whom he had the least affection.</p>

<p>“There’s the grenadiers,” said Jud; “and the
new regiment, the 35th and the 49th.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there are the marines,” added Don.
“They all look pretty fine, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“They look fine enough now,” replied Jud,
“but just you wait till our men get a shot at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
them. You know how it was at Lexington and
Concord.”</p>

<p>Don knew indeed, and the thought of that
memorable day cheered him considerably.</p>

<p>By now most of the troops had assembled, and
one regiment already was marching off. The
boys hastened to follow along Common Street.</p>

<p>“My, but it’s hot! Whew!” cried Jud. “I’m
most melted.”</p>

<p>“I am too,” Don grinned. “I’m glad I don’t
have to carry a pack and a musket. Just listen
to the firing now!”</p>

<p>Although the sun was high overhead, neither
boy thought of being hungry. Down Queen
Street they hurried and past the town hall into
King Street. People were standing on street
corners and watching from doors and windows
as the King’s troops swung past over the rough
street. Small boys, shouting loudly to one another,
were hurrying along beside the splendid,
well-disciplined columns; and dogs of all sizes
were running here and there, barking shrilly.
One little fellow, all black with white spots, ran
diagonally through the column and then, turning
swiftly, ran back again as if for the sole purpose
of showing that he could do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>The boys saw the regiment march out upon
Long Wharf, where boats were waiting to carry
them north toward Charlestown. Then they saw
another and another regiment swing down King
Street and move out upon the wharf.</p>

<p>“Are they all going to embark here?” asked
Jud.</p>

<p>“No,” replied a man who was standing near
by. “Some of ’em are on the way to North
Battery.”</p>

<p>“Come on up there then,” said Don.</p>

<p>When the boys reached the battery most of the
British who were embarking at that point were
already in the boats.</p>

<p>By now some of the people in the North End
had climbed to the roofs of their houses, from
which points they would have an unobstructed
view of Charlestown across the water and of the
men-of-war. As the boys were coming from the
North Battery, Jud shouted to a man who was
perched astride his gabled roof: “Hey, there, is
there room for two more?”</p>

<p>“Come right along if you’re not Tories,” replied
the man. “I reckon it wouldn’t be safe for
a Tory up here beside me to-day.”</p>

<p>Jud, impetuous by nature, ran to the ladder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
that was leaning against the house, and Don,
naturally cautious but in the excitement forgetful
of everything, followed him. In a minute the
boys were beside the man—John Short, a saddle-maker—and
were looking eagerly across the
water.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>FROM A HOUSETOP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two boys and their patriotic friend, the
saddle-maker, saw the barges loaded with red-clad
soldiers steering for the point northeast of
Charlestown and later saw the barges return for
more troops. Close in toward the Charlestown
shore they could see the men-of-war <i>Falcon</i>,
<i>Lively</i>, <i>Somerset</i> and <i>Symmetry</i>, and all were firing
at the little redoubt on the hill beyond the
town.</p>

<p>“Who’s that walking along the top of the fort
there?” Don asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Whoever he is, he’d better keep down,” said
Jud.</p>

<p>“I can’t be sure at this distance,” replied the
saddle-maker, “but from the size and appearance
of him I’d say he was Colonel Prescott.”</p>

<p>Afterward the boys learned that the man was
Colonel Prescott and that his apparent disregard
for the fire of the British was for the purpose of
heartening the men within the fort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>About mid-afternoon all the fire from the men-of-war
and the British batteries seemed to concentrate
on the little fort.</p>

<p>“There they go!” cried Short. “The attack’s
begun.”</p>

<p>The regulars were advancing in two divisions;
one division moved straight up the hill toward the
fort; the other moved toward the fortifications
beyond the hill—which could not be seen from
the roof. Burdened with heavy equipment, and
with the hot sun blazing down on their heads, the
British walked slowly over the uneven ground.
When they had gone some distance they opened
fire and continued to fire as they advanced. A
few scattering shots from the hill answered
them.</p>

<p>“Our men are withholding their fire till it’ll
count,” said Short. “A wise thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish they’d hurry and fire,” said Jud.
“Just see how close the Redcoats are to the fort!”</p>

<p>The stretch of green and brown field between
the redoubt and the front line of advancing regulars
was growing smaller and smaller. From
beyond the hill came a rattling roar of muskets
and of field-pieces. Then came a heavy volley
from the fort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“Look! Look!” cried Short and in his excitement
almost let go his hold.</p>

<p>The regulars returned the fire, and then amid
the rattling, crackling hail of musket balls the
ranks wavered and then broke. Down the hill
haphazard the trained troops of King George
retreated; but they left many of their number
behind on the slope.</p>

<p>Meanwhile shells that had fallen inside Charlestown
had set many of the wooden buildings on
fire, and the flames were spreading with great
rapidity. Blue smoke was curling upward from
the spires of the public buildings to mingle with
the deeper blue of the sky. Little tongues of
yellow flame were licking the sides and roofs of
many of the smaller houses. In a few minutes
the crash of falling beams mingled with the roar
and rattle of cannon and musket.</p>

<p>The regulars rallied and advanced again, but
they could not go far in the face of the terrible
fire that poured down upon them. As at Lexington,
Don could see red-coated officers urging
and threatening their men with brightly gleaming swords,
but it was of no use. Again the lines
broke, and the King’s troops retreated, this time
in greater disorder than the first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“They’re brave men; I’ll say that for them,”
said Short.</p>

<p>Don and Jud thought so too, but neither said
a word; the terrible spectacle seemed to have
taken away their power to speak.</p>

<p>It was a long time before the Redcoats rallied
and advanced for the third time.</p>

<p>“They’ve left off their knapsacks this trip,”
said Short. “They’ll do better, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>It was only too true, for the gallant Americans
had used most of their ammunition. They met the
attack bravely, and then the fire from the fort
suddenly slackened. In a few minutes the regulars
were at the walls. Then a great cloud of
dust rose above the works as the defenders reluctantly
gave way. The British, who were on
three sides of the redoubt, rushed forward and,
swarming over the walls, sent up a great cheer,
which came faintly across the water. Then they
opened fire on the retreating Continentals.</p>

<p>The boys could see little groups of soldiers beyond
on the slopes of Bunker Hill, but by now
the dust was so thick that they could hardly distinguish
which side the men belonged to. Intermittent
firing continued for some time, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
warm air was saturated with the pungent odor of
powder.</p>

<p>“Victory for the Redcoats,” said Jud in a
choking voice, and Don nodded in agreement.
There was such a lump in his throat that he would
not trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe,” said Short, “but I’m a-thinking
it’s a pretty costly victory for old King
George.”</p>

<p>And so it proved to be. The town of Boston
wore a gloomy aspect during the next few days.
The King’s troops, who had looked so fine on
parade on the morning of the battle, went about
dispiritedly and muttered among themselves at
the awful price that they had paid for the hill.</p>

<p>When Don reached home late that evening the
sound of cannon was still ringing in his ears—indeed
the guns did not cease firing until the next
afternoon. He told his aunt what he had seen,
but omitted a good deal out of sympathy for her
feelings. But though Aunt Martha had not seen
so much as her nephew she seemed to know quite
as much about what had happened as he did; and
all her anxiety, all her thoughts were for her husband
and for Glen Drake.</p>

<p>Almost all of the next day, which was Sunday,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
she spent in reading the Bible; nor would she
permit her nephew to stir from the house. “I
want you with me, Donald,” she said. “Something
tells me that your uncle was in the battle,
and something tells me that everything did not
go just right.”</p>

<p>“But, Aunt Martha, you can’t be sure,” said
Don. “I’m just going to suppose that he was
there and didn’t get a scratch.”</p>

<p>Although Aunt Martha did not reply her eyes
said plainly that she wished she could think as her
nephew did.</p>

<p>To relieve the depressed and disgruntled Redcoats
the Tories took upon themselves the work
of patrolling the streets at night. Every evening
forty-nine of them went on duty, and once Don
saw Tom Bullard, dressed in a green uniform,
hurrying importantly along Cornhill apparently
with a message from his chief, General Ruggles.
That was the same evening after General Gage
had issued another proclamation calling upon the
townspeople again to turn over to him any firearms
that they still possessed.</p>

<p>“Aunt Martha,” said Don, “you know there’s
some powder among that stuff in the cellar. Do
you suppose we’d better turn that in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“No,” replied his aunt firmly. “Only to have
the Redcoats use it against our own men! Never!
If the cellar were full of swords and muskets, I’d
not say a word about them to anyone who wears
a red coat. Maybe some day that powder will
be useful in the hands of those who really deserve
it.”</p>

<p>It was now nearing the end of June, but not
a word, not the slightest hint concerning the fate
of either David Hollis or Glen Drake had
reached Aunt Martha’s ears. Together Don and
his aunt had visited the hospitals where both
Americans and British wounded soldiers were
being cared for; yet not a thing could they find
out. Instead of feeling encouraged, however,
Aunt Martha became more and more worried,
and oddly enough Don soon began to feel much
as she did.</p>

<p>One bit of information of quite a different sort
did, however, seep into the beleaguered town.
Rumor had it that a valiant soldier from Virginia—Col.
George Washington—was coming to
Cambridge to take command of the entire Continental
army. Don heard the news from Jud,
who in turn had heard it from a storekeeper in
Orange Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“Col. George Washington—why, he was with
Braddock and saved what remained of the British
army after the French and Indians had ambushed
them.” Don’s eyes were wide with admiration.
“When’s he coming, Jud? Say, he’s a great
man!”</p>

<p>“He’s one of the finest soldiers there ever was,”
said Jud. “He’ll make things hum when he
arrives. Give him an army and he won’t be long
in driving the Redcoats into the sea!”</p>

<p>“When’s he coming?” Don asked again.</p>

<p>“Oh, in a few days, so they say. I heard that
he’s already on his way and that Congress had
made him commander-in-chief just a day or so
before the fight over Charlestown way.”</p>

<p>“I’d surely like to see him,” said Don. “Glen
Drake knows him and has fought beside him.
He says he’s the finest looking man he ever
saw.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard anything of Glen or your
uncle?”</p>

<p>Don immediately became grave. “Not a word,
Jud,” he replied.</p>

<p>The first two weeks in July came and passed,
and it was known definitely that General Washington
had reached Cambridge and had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
command of the army beneath a large spreading
elm tree.</p>

<p>Still no word came concerning David Hollis.
Aunt Martha went mechanically about her housework
and had got into the habit of reading much
and of talking little. Other people who had relatives
in the Continental army had managed to get
word of them—somehow; but David Hollis and
his friend, the trapper,—it seemed at times almost
as if they never had existed.</p>

<p>The friendship between David and Jud seemed
to grow stronger each day, and the boys spent
most of their time together. One evening, Jud,
in response to an invitation from Aunt Martha,
came to spend the afternoon and night at the
house in Pudding Lane. The boys had intended
to go fishing that afternoon, but unfortunately
rain began to fall around noon and increased to a
steady, violent downpour as the afternoon wore
on.</p>

<p>By five o’clock it was so dark that Aunt Martha
had to light a candle in order to see to read.
Rain was still falling, and with it came a heavy
fog that swept like smoke through the narrow
streets.</p>

<p>“It’s good we didn’t so fishing,” said Jud.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
“This is a regular northeast storm. Probably it
will last for two or three days.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s growing cold,” said Aunt
Martha. “Donald, I think we’d better have a
fire.”</p>

<p>Between the two of them the boys soon had a
cheerful, crackling fire on the hearth; and by the
light of it Aunt Martha became more like her old
self. During supper she laughed frequently with
the boys, especially when Jud told of his many
pets. And afterward she played fox and geese
with them. “I declare, Jud,” she said, “I’m
glad you came.”</p>

<p>The evening passed swiftly and pleasantly,
though outside the wind was howling and sending
the heavy drops of rain spattering against the
windows.</p>

<p>Don and Jud had finished their last game, and
Aunt Martha was looking at them inquiringly,
when suddenly the knocker on the door rose and
fell.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Aunt Martha, startled.</p>

<p>“Now who can that be?” said Don and went
to the door.</p>

<p>He opened it a crack and then stepped backward
in astonishment as a man pushed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
way inside and hastily closed the door behind
him.</p>

<p>“Glen—Glen!” cried Aunt Martha and fairly
flew to meet the visitor.</p>

<p>Don was too much surprised to speak. He
only looked on dumbly as the old trapper caught
his aunt’s hands and drew her swiftly into the
shadows away from the window.</p>

<p>“Glen,” said Aunt Martha, “only one thing
could bring you here—David——”</p>

<p>“Is well,” replied the trapper and sat down
in one of the chairs. “He’s been sick, Martha—he
was wounded at Bunker’s Hill—but he’s doing
well. There’s no cause for worry.”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha drew a deep breath and sank into
a chair beside him.</p>

<p>“Don, my boy, how are you?” asked Glen.
“I see you’re taking good care of your aunt.
And this——” He glanced at Jud searchingly
for a moment.</p>

<p>“This is Jud Appleton,” said Aunt Martha.
“Don’s close companion and as loyal as any of
us.”</p>

<p>Jud winced under the trapper’s grip and from
that moment would have followed his lead anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“I told you he’d come if he wanted to,”
whispered Don.</p>

<p>Though Glen was naturally a man of few
words he did most of the talking during the two
hours that he remained at the house in Pudding
Lane. He had crossed from Cambridge under
cover of rain and darkness and would return the
same way. David Hollis, he said, had received a
ball through the shoulder during the third assault
of the Redcoats on the hill and was now at Cambridge,
where he would probably remain until he
was fully recovered; then he would rejoin his
company.</p>

<p>Glen had had two reasons for coming, it
seemed; one was to acquaint Aunt Martha with
the exact condition of her husband; the other was
to bring money, which both he and David Hollis
feared she was sorely in need of.</p>

<p>For perhaps half an hour he and Aunt Martha
talked in low whispers. Then he raised his voice
and spoke of events that had happened concerning
the Continental army, and both boys bent
forward eagerly to listen.</p>

<p>“You boys just ought to see Cambridge,” he
said. “Soldiers everywhere—fine-looking fellows
from up north, dark, handsome boys from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the South. I tell you it’s a sight to see them on
parade. And tents—hundreds of ’em of all
sorts. Those of the Rhode Islanders are all
canvas, but the others—why, they’re part sailcloth
and part wood, and some are mostly mud
and branches. And fortifications all over; Boston
Neck and Charlestown Neck are sealed tight,
you might say.”</p>

<p>Glen paused and filled his pipe. “It’s a funny
thing,” he continued; “not many years ago the
settlers faced their fortifications the opposite way
to protect their homes against the Injuns; now
it’s an enemy from the east they’ve got to protect
themselves against.”</p>

<p>“And have you seen Colonel Washington?”
asked Jud.</p>

<p>“Seen him! I should say so!” The old
trapper’s face lighted up, and his eyes gleamed
in the shadows. “There’s not a better officer alive.
He’s what you call an officer and a gentleman,
and he looks the part every inch when he’s on his
big horse. He wears a blue uniform faced with
buff and a black cockade in his hat—but you
ought to see him. I’m no hand at describing.”</p>

<p>Glen had another talk alone with Aunt Martha
before he finally shook everyone by the hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
bade them keep up their spirits and then, muffling
his face with the collar of his coat, slipped noiselessly
out into the night.</p>

<p>“Now, you boys, to bed with you,” said Aunt
Martha. “And don’t lie awake, talking.”</p>

<p>But her good advice was given in vain; the boys
lay awake until long into the night, talking of
the wily old trapper who somehow had entered
the town right under the Redcoats’ nose without
their knowing it.</p>

<p>“I told you he’d come if he wanted to,” Don
repeated exultantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he’ll get back easily too,” said Jud.
“I’d pity any Redcoat who tried to stop him.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” said Don, thinking of how Glen
had acted on the evening when they had crossed
the flats together and had met the British sentry.</p>

<p>“Are you boys asleep?” came the voice of
Aunt Martha.</p>

<p>Only the echoes answered her question.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE LIBERTY TREE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the end of July both the people of Boston
and the King’s soldiers were beginning to feel the
ill effects of the siege. One of the main troubles
was the food. Civilian and soldier alike were
obliged to eat much salt fish and meat—so much
in fact that sickness and fever broke out, especially
in the army. Don and his aunt were
rather better off than most folks, for at the beginning
of the trouble the store had been well
stocked, and, moreover, Aunt Martha now had
money with which to buy fresh eggs and vegetables.</p>

<p>With the increasing discontent owing to improper
food individual Redcoats became more
arrogant toward the townsfolk, whom they far
outnumbered. There were fewer than seven
thousand inhabitants; whereas, the troops and
their dependents numbered close to fourteen
thousand.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” said Aunt Martha, “how is it ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
going to end? How much longer are we to live
this way, insulted and persecuted on every
hand?”</p>

<p>“It seems that every time they have a skirmish
with Washington’s men,” said Don, “they take
their spite out on us. Well, just you wait, Aunt
Martha; General Washington will show them he
means business. He can’t do it now because his
army isn’t ready; he has to train his men. And
besides, he needs more powder and cannon
and——”</p>

<p>“Why, Donald, where do you learn all these
things?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jud and I hear folks talking. Sometimes
we hear when we’re pretending not to.
Jud says that’s the thing to do.”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>“We were down on Essex Street yesterday
near the Liberty Tree,” Don continued, “and
heard some Tories and Redcoats talking. One
of the Tories said, ‘These stubborn rebels’—meaning
us, Aunt Martha,—‘think they’ll do
wonders now that they’ve appointed a Virginian
head of their upstart army; but they’re wrong; if
great Cæsar himself were head of that army he
couldn’t make ’em stand up and fight!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“Then one of the soldiers—I thought at first
it was Harry Hawkins, but it wasn’t—faced
around quick and said, ‘Were you at Lexin’ton
or Bunker’s Hill?’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ the Tory replied.</p>

<p>“‘Well, then,’ said the Redcoat, ‘what do you
know about it? I was at Lexin’ton, and I was
over at Charlestown last June, and I <i>know</i> they
can fight. I hate ’em just as much as you do,
my friend,’ he said, ‘but I respect them too.
They can fight. If they’d had lots of powder,
we’d never have taken that hill. And another
thing, I know this man Washington. I should say
I do! I was with Braddock. And when Washington
gets his army trained and has plenty of
ammunition I tell you we’re a-going to have a
fight on our hands, and don’t you forget it!’”</p>

<p>“What did the Tory say?” asked Aunt Martha.</p>

<p>“He didn’t say anything. He just shrugged
his shoulders and turned away. That’s how a
Tory is, Aunt Martha; he’ll talk a lot and let
the Redcoats do the fighting.”</p>

<p>Certainly the Tories had much to talk about.
It must have given them much satisfaction to see
their neighbors imprisoned on false charges. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
Lovell, the schoolmaster, charged with being a
spy, was confined for sixty-five days. John Gill,
a close friend of Don’s uncle, was imprisoned for
twenty-nine days for printing what had displeased
General Gage.</p>

<p>But even numerous vexations and wrongs of
that sort were not enough to satisfy the Tories.
They themselves were suffering from the siege,
and they wanted to punish the whole people of
Boston, who they said were the cause of their
suffering. Just what a malicious form of punishment
they chose Don and Jud were soon to
learn.</p>

<p>Early one morning the two boys were on their
way to Coffin’s Field to get bait for fishing. Each
was lightly dressed, and both were hurrying along
briskly. The sun was pushing its way up warm
and bright and seemed to promise a good day.
They had come down Newbury Street and were
turning into Essex when Jud pointed to the
Liberty Tree, a great elm that stood on the southeast
corner. “That’s what I call the finest tree
that ever grew,” he said.</p>

<p>“It surely is pretty,” replied Don; “just look
how dainty and green the leaves are, and how the
limbs curve way up and hang over like long ferns.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Yes, I’d say an elm is about the finest tree that
ever grew.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking of the appearance of it so
much,” Jud replied, “though it surely is a
beauty. I was thinking rather of what it means.
It stands for Liberty. Don’t you remember
how, whenever there used to be trouble with King
George, folks would flock to the tree?”</p>

<p>“They do still, for that matter.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, but I was thinking of one night
when I was just a little fellow. I don’t remember
just what had happened—the repeal of a
stamp law maybe—anyway Ma took me to the
tree, and there it was covered with lanterns and
a big flag flying from the pole in the centre up
there, and everybody was laughing and singing
and ringing bells. Oh, it surely was fine!”</p>

<p>Still talking about the tree, the boys went on
down Essex Street and a few minutes later were
at Coffin’s Field. Jud led the way to a far corner
of it, where they began to dig.</p>

<p>For almost three-quarters of an hour they
worked, turning over great clods of earth; but
grub worms, which they particularly wanted,
were scarce.</p>

<p>“How many have we got?” asked Don.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Jud counted them. “Only fourteen,” he replied.
“Let’s try over there behind that pig-pen.”</p>

<p>The ground behind the pig-pen proved somewhat
better, and at last, with a fair supply of
worms, the boys started back along Essex Street.</p>

<p>They were perhaps half-way to Newbury
Street when they heard loud talking and boisterous
laughter. A minute later they saw a crowd—mostly
soldiers and Tories—at the corner.</p>

<p>Suddenly the two boys stopped short. Don
grasped Jud’s arm and in a choking voice cried,
“See what they’ve done!”</p>

<p>Jud was speechless; his lips moved, but he
made no sound. There in front of them, the
centre of a boorish mob, lay the Liberty Tree!
It had been cut down near the base. The delicate
leaves and slender twigs were being trampled
underfoot as Tories and Redcoats moved here
and there, laughing, shouting and swearing.
Great limbs that once had swayed so gracefully
in the breeze were scattered about along the
street; deep white gashes showed where the cruel
axe had bitten into them. And the odor of green
wood filled the moist warm air.</p>

<p>“J-Jud!” cried Don.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>But Jud did not utter a word. His ruddy
face was pale, and his cheeks seemed suddenly
hollow.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of your fine tree
now?” said a mocking voice.</p>

<p>Both boys turned and confronted—Tom Bullard.</p>

<p>“You dirty, sneaking chicken-thief!” cried
Jud and would have hurled himself against the
Tory if Don had not held him.</p>

<p>“Now, none of that,” said Tom and retreated
a step or two. Then he turned and walked away,
whistling.</p>

<p>“See here,” said a bystander, “I guess you
boys feel as bad as I do about it, but don’t be
hotheads. They’re too many for us.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” asked Don unsteadily.</p>

<p>“Job Williams, the Tory, led the mob,” replied
the man. “And a mob it surely was. Such
a lot of swearing and yelling—it’s good you
missed it. Redcoats and Tories alike swarmed
up the tree like so many thick-lipped gorillas.
But it wasn’t all fine for them. Just before you
came one of the soldiers in the topmost branches
missed his hold and fell. I saw him fall; he was
killed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“Good!” cried Jud, clenching his fists.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I said.” The man smiled.
“They carted him off a few minutes ago. It was
the hand of Providence that did it, my lads, and
the hand of Providence will account for many
more of them before long.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of here,” said Don. “It
makes me sick to look. Just hear ’em yelling.”</p>

<p>Each boy picked up a twig from the street,
and, thrusting it into his pocket, hurried up Newbury
Street toward Hog Alley.</p>

<p>There was no fishing for Don or for Jud that
day. What they had seen in the morning had
taken away all their desire for sport. And Aunt
Martha felt quite as bad about the destruction of
the tree as the boys did. “If there’s one thing I
can’t abide,” she said, “it’s spite work.”</p>

<p>The Liberty Tree yielded the soldiers fourteen
cords of wood, but they had paid dearly for it.
Other trees also were cut down for the sake of
the wood, and before winter set in the Common
had lost many of its fine old elms.</p>

<p>September passed, and with the turning of the
leaves Don longed to go forth into the woods.
“Say, Aunt Martha,” he remarked one day, “I
never knew that the town was so small. There’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
no place to go without seeing Redcoats. I’d like
to go off somewhere in the woods.”</p>

<p>“Have patience, Donald. Maybe if you wait,
some day the whole continent will be free for you
to come and go in as you please.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the Colonies will be independent,
Aunt Martha? Do you really want them
to be?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I think it, and I hope it.” Aunt
Martha’s lips were set in a straight line, as they
had been when she had told her husband that she
would not leave her home for the sake of a Redcoat.</p>

<p>Don was about to make some reply when he
spied Jud outside the window; he was hurrying
up the street, and there was an eager look in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jud,” Don greeted him as he opened
the door. “What’s the news?”</p>

<p>“Good news,” Jud replied breathlessly. “I’ve
heard that old Gage is going back to England.
How glad I am!”</p>

<p>“Say, where did you hear that?” asked
Don.</p>

<p>“Over near Faneuil Hall. I was listening
again.” Jud grinned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Who’s to take his place?” asked Aunt
Martha.</p>

<p>“Don’t know yet. But won’t it be fine to see
old Gage go? He’s caused enough trouble for
half a dozen men.”</p>

<p>The news proved to be true enough. On the
tenth of October, General Gage sailed for England,
never to return. Lord Howe, who had
commanded the British in the assault at Charlestown,
took Gage’s place. He was popular with
the troops, but with the suffering townsfolk he
was a poor substitute for the unpopular Gage.
The proclamations that he issued were irritating
at best; he seemed to think only of the safety
and comfort of his soldiers.</p>

<p>One of his first acts was to erect new fortifications.
Then he requisitioned private dwellings
and some of the meeting-houses for the use of
his men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>A BLUSTERING SERGEANT-MAJOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Donald</span>, someone’s at the door. Hurry and
answer it.” Aunt Martha’s voice sounded from
her nephew’s room up-stairs, which she was
sweeping.</p>

<p>Knock, knock—<i>knock</i>!</p>

<p>“He’s pretty anxious to make us hear,” said
Don as he crossed the floor of the living-room.</p>

<p>Knock!</p>

<p>Don opened the door and looked full into the
face of a red-haired, red-coated British sergeant-major,
who at once inserted his foot and pushed
his way inside the room. “Who lives here besides
yourself, young sire?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Don stared at him and thought he had never
seen such an ugly-looking fellow. He was big
and broad and flabby, and the only thing about
him that was not red, it seemed, were his eyes,
which were a pale, washed-out blue.</p>

<p>“Don’t stand there and stare!” the sergeant-major
bellowed. “Tell me who lives here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“My Aunt Martha Hollis and I and my uncle
David, who’s with the Continental army just at
present,” replied Don.</p>

<p>The soldier snorted and then hurried to face
Aunt Martha, who had come down-stairs. “Is
that right?” he asked in a surly but milder voice.</p>

<p>“My nephew has told you the truth,” Aunt
Martha replied with dignity.</p>

<p>“How many rooms are in the house?”</p>

<p>“The living-room and three rooms up-stairs.”</p>

<p>The sergeant-major produced a piece of paper.
“Show me to the rooms up-stairs,” he said and
walked toward the stairway.</p>

<p>“Why do you wish to see them?” asked Aunt
Martha, somewhat alarmed and bewildered.</p>

<p>The soldier made no reply but mounted the
steps. Don followed him closely. After a brief
inspection of the rooms they came down, and the
soldier wrote something on the slip of paper.
“You’ll have two men to billet,” he said. “So
you’d better fix up that big room at the front.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do nothing of the sort,” Aunt Martha
said indignantly.</p>

<p>The man’s red face became redder than ever;
he started to say something, then checked himself
and laughed. “Two men,” he repeated and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
strode toward the door and slammed it behind
him.</p>

<p>“O Donald!” cried Aunt Martha. “If your
uncle were only here!”</p>

<p>Don clenched his fists. “Two Redcoats to live
with us all winter!” he exclaimed. “That’s
what it means, Aunt Martha.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” said his aunt and sat down by the
window. “Two—two Redcoats to track in
mud and dirt and scratch and tear things with
their heavy shoes——”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t worry, Aunt Martha,” Don interrupted
her. “Maybe it won’t be so bad, having
them here. And maybe before long General
Washington will have his army ready to drive all
of them out of the town.”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha soon recovered her spirits and
set about making ready for the two unwelcome
guests. “I suppose if they insist on having the
big front room, we’ll have to give it to them,”
she said. “I don’t see any other way out of
it.”</p>

</figure>

<p>Nevertheless, she spent most of the day in
cleaning the spare bedroom, and when Don
looked at it that afternoon he could not help
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>smiling. “You’ve made it the best-looking room
in the house,” he said. “Maybe they’ll prefer it
to the big room.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I had in mind,” his aunt
replied and smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, say!” exclaimed Don, and his face suddenly
became pale. “All that stuff in the cellar—what
if they should discover it!”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha shared her nephew’s agitation,
and she bit her lips in perplexity. “I haven’t
thought of that,” she said. “We’ll just have to
run our chances and see that the door is kept
locked always.”</p>

<p>“We’d surely find ourselves in hot water if
they happened to learn that it’s there,” said Don.
“Oh, how I hate ’em all!” he cried impulsively.</p>

<p>The next morning when the two soldiers came
with all their equipment Don and his aunt got a
surprise that for Don at least was not altogether
unpleasant. One of the Redcoats was Private
Harry Hawkins!</p>

<p>He nodded and smiled at Don as he and his
comrade entered the house and were shown up-stairs.</p>

<p>The man who was with him, a short, dark-haired
fellow, stopped at the door of Aunt Martha’s
room. “This is it, Hawkins,” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
“The big room on the front, the sergeant-major
said, and a fine room it is. We’re in luck, you
and I.”</p>

<p>Hawkins looked at Aunt Martha and, observing
the troubled expression in her eyes, said, “Is
this the room you want us to occupy?”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” she replied. “That’s my room,
and the one across the hall is my nephew’s. Next
to his is the room I’d hoped you would occupy—since
it seems you’ve got to occupy a room of
some sort.”</p>

<p>“That’s the room we’ll have, then,” said Hawkins
promptly and carried his equipment into it.</p>

<p>But his companion did not follow him; he stood
looking into the big room.</p>

<p>“Come on, Snell,” said Hawkins, laughing.
“The other room is plenty big enough. Anyone
would think you were six feet, five, instead of five
feet, six.”</p>

<p>Grumbling, the fellow turned away reluctantly
and entered the room that Aunt Martha had
made ready for them.</p>

<p>Both Don and his aunt gave Hawkins a look
of thanks and then went down-stairs. For some
time they sat in silence and listened to the scuffling
of feet on the floor above them. Then Don said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
in a low voice: “It might have been worse,
mightn’t it?”</p>

<p>His aunt nodded. “I suppose it might,” she
admitted. “One of them seems a gentlemanly
fellow.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, Hawkins and Snell were in the
house very little during the daytime. They
would rise early and hurry off to eat mess with
their company; then they might return for a few
minutes only to hurry out to the parade grounds.
Usually they were away somewhere during the
afternoon and evening. On the whole they were
not much bother; it was the mere fact that Aunt
Martha had to have them that irritated her
most.</p>

<p>Jud’s mother also had suffered. Jud told Don
about it one evening at Aunt Martha’s. “We’ve
got only one,” he said, “but he’s a sergeant-major—big
and fat and red-faced and uglier than
a mud fence!”</p>

<p>“With blue eyes and a red nose?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Yes, little mean eyes that somehow make me
think of buttermilk.”</p>

<p>“Probably it’s the sergeant-major who came
to us,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Probably it is,” added his aunt dryly. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
don’t see how there could be two men quite so
ugly as he.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a billeting sergeant,” said Jud,
“and his name is Bluster.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” said Don. “He’s well named.”</p>

<p>“Just listen to that wind outside,” said Aunt
Martha; “that’s blustery enough too!”</p>

<p>The wind had been blustery and sharp for several
days, and almost before the boys realized it
winter had set in in dead earnest. And with the
cold came increased suffering. Fuel was scarce,
and the army had hard work getting it. But they
did get it, nevertheless, and the way they went
about it added another grievance to the long list
that the townsfolk held against them. Buildings
were torn down—usually they were the poorest
structures, but not always—fences disappeared
overnight, and gates that had creaked on their
hinges one day were missing the next morning.</p>

<p>In December the town presented its most deplorable
aspect. Hostile cannon glowered in
position on hill and thoroughfare, and insolent
soldiers such as Sergeant-Major Bluster and
Private Snell sat about hearthstones where once
happy families had been wont to gather. Food
as well as fuel was extremely scarce, and prices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
were so high that more than one person was
driven to steal. Faneuil Hall had been turned
into a playhouse for the amusement of the Redcoats,
and in it the fine spirit of the people, their
intense desire for peace and liberty and fair treatment,
were turned into ridicule. Even when
snow fell and covered the suffering town in a soft
white blanket, and few soldiers were on the streets
to jostle and mock pedestrians, the guns on Beacon
Hill boomed forth as if to remind them that
Howe and the King’s troops still held sway.</p>

<p>Hundreds of persons, too poor longer to support
themselves, had obtained Howe’s permission
to depart in boats to Point Shirley, whence they
made their way into the country—homeless,
penniless and miserable. But still Aunt Martha’s
will would not allow her to yield. “No—no,”
she declared more than once, “I’ll not go! The
good Lord knows how I long to be with David,
but I know that he is being well cared for. Glen
gave me his word, and he is a man I’d trust to
the ends of the earth.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lancaster, who happened to be calling,
only shook her head.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you think I’m stubborn,” Don’s
aunt continued. “Perhaps I am, but I intend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
to remain right here in my own home, and that’s
an end of it.”</p>

<p>One day in January, Don and Jud went to
Aunt Martha with a request that Don be permitted,
as Jud said, to “go some place” the following
evening.</p>

<p>“Where do you want to go, Don?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Down to Faneuil Hall,” Don said quickly.
“There’s something or other going on there, and
we’d like to see it.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be music,” added Jud.</p>

<p>“British music,” said Aunt Martha.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, but it may sound all right.”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha frowned.</p>

<p>“Oh, say, Aunt Martha,” exclaimed Don,
laughing, “we won’t become Tories—honest. It’s
mighty dull here these days, and we want to see
what’s going on. It’s all right, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>If Aunt Martha was stubborn she seldom
showed it where her nephew was concerned, and
this time was no exception to the rule. She
yielded to him—whereas the whole force of General
Howe only made her the more resolute!</p>

<p>“Good for you, Aunt Martha,” said Jud—he
had got into the habit of calling her “aunt,” and
she seemed rather pleased with him for doing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“I picked up some information to-day,” he
added. “Our privateers have been doing some
great things on the high seas. They’ve captured
hundreds of the King’s vessels.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of Captain Manly,” said Aunt
Martha.</p>

<p>“Well, there are lots besides Captain Manly,”
Jud replied. “And another thing—our men
have chosen a flag; it’s called the Union Flag of
the Thirteen Stripes—one stripe for each Colony,
you see. They raised it the first day of the
year.”</p>

<p>“My, my, Judson. Where you and Donald
learn all these things is a mystery to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” replied the resourceful Jud,
“if we go to Faneuil Hall to-morrow night we’ll
probably learn more, hey, Don?”</p>

<p>But at that moment Snell and Hawkins entered,
and the conversation ceased.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>A FARCE IS INTERRUPTED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dusk</span> had fallen over the town when Don and
Jud, warmly clad in heavy coats and mufflers,
made their way toward Faneuil Hall. Others
were walking in the same direction—mostly
officers, who stepped with the firmness and confidence
that marked an officer of the King. The
night was cold and dark, and few lights gleamed
as they once had gleamed, cheerily, in the windows
of the shops along King Street and Merchant’s
Row; yet there was cheery conversation.
The boys could hear laughing and congenial talking
among the hurrying throngs.</p>

<p>“I just feel like laughing good and hard to-night,”
they heard one man say.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I too,” another agreed. “There’s
been little enough to laugh at ever since we landed
in this town.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll laugh to-night, or I’m a Dutchman,”
said a third. “There’s to be a farce called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
the Blockade of Boston. Funny! I thought I’d
laugh myself sick the first time I heard it rehearsed.
I tell you the officers who wrote it—let’s
see; who was it now? Well, never mind;
they certainly wrote a funny play. Just wait
till you catch sight of General Washington!”</p>

<p>Jud scowled in the darkness. “Remember,
Don,” he whispered, “we’ll have to keep a firm
hold on our tempers.”</p>

<p>Don laughed. “I’ll keep a firm hold of mine,
Jud; but I’m not so sure about you. You’re
hot-headed, you know.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about me,” said Jud. “He
who laughs last, you know——”</p>

<p>“But say,” Don interrupted him, “you haven’t
told me yet how we’re going to get inside the
place.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” replied Jud and thrust his elbow
knowingly into his companion’s ribs. “This will
get us inside, I think,” and he drew something
small and shiny from his pocket and handed it
to Don.</p>

<p>“A silver snuff-box,” said Don, looking at it
with some wonder.</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s Sergeant-Major Bluster’s. He
couldn’t seem to find it to-day. Funny, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
’cause if he’d asked me, I could have told him
right where it was all the time—in my pocket.
Do you understand now?”</p>

<p>Don did not understand and said so emphatically.</p>

<p>Jud laughed good-naturedly. “You’re pretty
dull sometimes,” he said frankly. “Just you let
me do the talking and we’ll be inside Faneuil
Hall in three shakes.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been doing most of the talking.” Don
could not resist the thrust. “So go ahead and
finish.”</p>

<p>“All right; now here we are.”</p>

<p>The boys had reached the hall, which was well
lighted and partly filled with troops. Don and
Jud stood to one side of the door and watched
the men as they came singly and in groups and
vanished inside the great building. There were
ladies too, most of them young, and all escorted
by gallant officers. Jud kept a sharp lookout
toward the door.</p>

<p>At last Don, a bit impatient at the delay,
asked, “How much longer are we going to
wait?”</p>

<p>“Just a few minutes, I think. I’m waiting
for fat Bluster—ah, here he comes, isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“You’re right,” said Don. “Look at the gait,
will you?”</p>

<p>Bluster strode pompously to the door, nodded
curtly to one of the soldiers who was on duty
there and passed into the hall.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Don.</p>

<p>“No; just a few minutes longer. Can’t you
wait?”</p>

<p>“Say, Jud, you’re a mystery to me to-night,”
said Don. “I don’t know what under the sun
you’re trying to do. I don’t think you know,
yourself!”</p>

<p>“Who’s doing all the talking now?” inquired
Jud with a grin.</p>

<p>For almost ten minutes the boys waited in the
cold. Then Jud led the way to the door. The
soldier on duty at once blocked the passage.
“Scat, you youngsters,” he said.</p>

<p>Jud surely had his temper well in hand that
night. “We’re looking for a sergeant-major,”
he said, smiling. “We’ve got to see him, for
we have something important that belongs to
him.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>Jud was embarrassed—at least, he showed
every sign of being embarrassed. “It’s—it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
just a little thing with a lady’s name engraved
on it.”</p>

<p>The soldier laughed. “Do you think you
could find him in there?”</p>

<p>“Between the two of us I think we could,”
Jud replied promptly.</p>

<p>“Well, be quick about it then.”</p>

<p>The boys were as quick as a flash.</p>

<p>“Young Tories,” the soldier said to a bystander
as they entered the building.</p>

<p>Jud turned abruptly, but Don grasped his arm
and pulled him along. “Don’t be a hothead,”
he whispered.</p>

<p>It was only luck that made Jud spy Bluster a
few moments later in the crowded hall. The
sergeant-major was sitting on a chair at the extreme
right of the hall. His hat was on the floor
beneath the chair, and he was leaning back with
his arms folded across his chest.</p>

<p>More than one Redcoat looked inquiringly at
the boys as they walked round the chairs and
benches, and thought no doubt that they were the
sons of some prominent Tory who had brought
them with him. As Jud was passing behind
Bluster’s chair he dropped his hat and, in picking
it up, succeeded in laying the ornamental snuff-box<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> 
on the hat of the soldier—a circumstance that
puzzled the fellow till the end of his days.</p>

<p>After that the boys found a secluded corner
where they stood, in the shadows, and waited for
the play to begin. In front of them were Redcoats,
talking and laughing and smoking. There
were a great many ladies, all of whom had come to
laugh at the expense of the townsfolk of Boston
and of the Continental army outside the town.
Fans were moving lightly to and fro, though
there was no need of fans in the cold building;
scabbards and buckles were clacking against the
wooden seats; and the lights round the small
stage jarred and flickered as couples moved in
front of them to their seats.</p>

<p>Don and Jud said little, but their eyes and ears
were alert. At last the music started, and some
time later the curtain on the stage was hauled up.
There were to be two plays that evening, the first
of which was called “The Busy Body.” The
boys watched the actors, all of whom were Redcoats,
and thought the thing rather dull and
stupid. But the audience seemed to enjoy it;
there were frequent bursts of applause and a
good deal of laughter.</p>

<p>“Huh,” said Jud as the curtain went down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
for the last time. “I guess you have to be a
Redcoat or a Tory to like a thing like that.”</p>

<p>“Look,” whispered Don. “Bluster’s found
his snuff-box.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough!”</p>

<p>It was all that the boys could do to keep from
laughing as they watched the big sergeant-major.
He had found his snuff-box indeed. In the uncertain
light his face was ruddier than ever, and
his little eyes seemed to be popping from his head
as he turned first to one side, then to the other.
He looked at the little box; he looked at his hat;
he looked at his cuffs as if the thing might have
been hidden there. Perhaps he thought he had
suddenly become a magician. Then he looked at
the ceiling, as if to find the person—or the bird—that
had succeeded in dropping it so that it had
landed on his hat beneath his chair. But even a
magician or a bird could not have done that!</p>

<p>He was still looking at the ceiling when the
lights were dimmed, and the curtain was hauled
up again. “The Blockade of Boston,” which
was to be played next, was a farce in which the
character who represented General Washington
was supposed to stride awkwardly upon the stage,
wearing a long rusty sword and a wig that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
many sizes too large for him; behind him walked
his servant, an uncouth country boy with a rusty
gun. But the audience was not to laugh at the
antics of the two that night.</p>

<p>The curtain had been up only a few moments
when the noise of firing sounded from a distance,
and then a red-coated sergeant burst into the hall
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“The Yankees are attacking our works on
Bunker’s Hill!”</p>

<p>Startling as the announcement was, it carried
only a ripple of mild excitement; for no doubt
many of the audience supposed that the sergeant’s
words were part of the farce that was to
be played. “A good beginning anyway,” a
lieutenant who was sitting in front of the boys
said to his neighbor and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>At that moment a general who was seated close
to the stage sprang to his feet. “Look,”
whispered Don. “There’s Howe himself. I
didn’t notice him before.”</p>

<p>“Officers to your posts!” cried the general in
a ringing voice.</p>

<p>Then there was excitement enough for anyone.
To the two boys it seemed as if the whole audience
rose and started for the doors at the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
instant. Women were screaming and several
had already fainted. Chairs and benches were
being overturned—one chair overturned with
Sergeant-Major Bluster in it. Scabbards were
clashing and men were shouting hoarse commands.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of here!” whispered Jud.</p>

<p>“All right; but wait till the rest have gone;
we’d be killed in that mob.”</p>

<p>“What a glorious ending to the ‘Blockade of
Boston’!” Jud exulted. “Couldn’t be better,
could it?”</p>

<p>In the excitement some of the lights round the
stage were blown out, and then the place was
so dark that you could hardly distinguish faces.</p>

<p>And in the street it was still darker. The boys
were among the last to leave the hall, and as they
stepped outside they could hear the rattle of
small arms and the sound of cheering away to
the north.</p>

<p>“It’s an attack on the town,” whispered Jud
excitedly. “That’s just what it is—a big attack!”</p>

<p>But, positive as Jud was, he was wrong, as
both boys found out later. General Putnam had
sent a party of perhaps two hundred Continentals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
under the command of Major Knowlton to destroy
fourteen houses along Mill Street in
Charlestown and to capture the British guards
who were stationed in them. Through a mistake
some of the houses were fired too soon, and the
flames gave the alarm to the enemy on Bunker
Hill. But the daring attempt was by no means
unsuccessful. Major Knowlton succeeded in
burning eight of the houses and in capturing five
prisoners. Washington himself was well pleased
with the venture.</p>

<p>But the thing that pleased Don and Jud most
was the untimely ending of the night’s entertainment.
No one thought of returning to the hall.</p>

<p>“Here comes Bluster,” said Jud, stepping into
a doorway on King Street to let the Redcoat pass.
“I don’t want him to see me.”</p>

<p>When the sergeant-major had passed, the boys
made their way hurriedly to Don’s house in Pudding
Lane, which they reached shortly before
eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Aunt Martha, “did you hear
anything of interest at the hall?”</p>

<p>“Did we?” repeated Don. “You tell what
happened, Jud!”</p>

<p>And Jud told her, not omitting the incident of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the snuff-box. And when he had finished, Don
thought his aunt laughed more heartily than she
had laughed since the blockade began. “I’m
glad you boys went,” she said. “I’m glad you
could see the fine officers discomfited. They deserve
it for the way some of them have acted.”</p>

<p>Jud was suddenly thoughtful. “What in the
world will I tell fat Bluster if he ever asks me
about the snuff-box?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Tell him the truth, Judson,” said Aunt Martha.
“But don’t tell him unless he asks you,”
she added with a smile.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what to tell him,” said Don.
“Tell him that the last time he used snuff he
sneezed and blew the box over the Old South
Meeting-House, and that when it came down it
landed right on top of his hat.”</p>

<p>“Donald!” exclaimed his aunt. “Now you
boys scat to bed—quick!”</p>

<p>“That’s the second time we’ve been scatted
to-night,” said Jud as he followed Don up-stairs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>A BROKEN LOCK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> many days the townsfolk and the soldiers
talked of the performance that the Continental
assault on Charlestown had interrupted. Don
and Jud joked about it frequently, but they were
always careful that neither Hawkins nor Snell
should overhear them.</p>

<p>If all the Redcoats had been like Hawkins, the
good people of Boston would have had little to
complain of. He was always courteous and considerate;
he seemed to spend as little time as possible
in the house and kept to his room even on
the coldest nights. The fellow was undoubtedly
a fine soldier and as loyal to his King as any of
them were, and secretly both Don and Jud admired
him for it. He seemed to have a genuine
affection for Don, though he rarely spoke more
than a few words at a time to the boy.</p>

<p>Snell, on the other hand, was surly and quick-tempered
and an ugly person to have about the
house. He was inquisitive also. Once Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
Martha found him trying to unlock the door to
the cellar, and though he desisted at sight of her,
the circumstance troubled her. It troubled Don
too, but there was something that troubled him
more than that. Snell had formed an acquaintance
with Tom Bullard, and the two spent much
time together.</p>

<p>“I tell you,” Don said to Jud one evening in
February, “I don’t like it one bit, the way those
two are together so much. Tom Bullard hates
us like poison—I know that’s why he tried to
steal your ma’s chickens—and I’m sure he’d like
nothing better than to make us uncomfortable
somehow.”</p>

<p>“But he can’t do anything, can he? You and
your aunt have complied with all the town regulations,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>Don did not reply at once. “Well, maybe,”
he said at last.</p>

<p>But Jud was not easily put off. “What do
you mean?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you something sometime,” said Don.
“Not now, though.”</p>

<p>Don might not have told his companion his
secret at all if it had not been for an unfortunate
event that occurred toward the end of the month.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
One Saturday when Aunt Martha had been at
the home of a sick neighbor almost all morning
Don entered the house in Pudding Lane and to
his consternation found Snell coming up from the
cellar with an armful of wood. The broken lock
lying on the floor told how the man had entered.</p>

<p>For several moments the two stood confronting
each other; Don’s face was flaming, and his heart
was beating a tattoo against his ribs. Snell, a bit
discomfited, soon recovered his poise. “It’s cold
in here,” he said; “I suspected all along that you
had wood in the cellar.”</p>

<p>“There’s wood out in the back shed too,” replied
Don in a voice that trembled slightly.
“Why didn’t you use that?”</p>

<p>Snell evidently thought no reply was necessary.
He crossed the floor and tossed several
sticks upon the fire.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you use the wood in the shed?”
repeated Don in a louder voice.</p>

<p>Snell looked at the boy tolerantly. “Now
see here, young sire,” he said slowly. “It won’t
do for you to ask too many questions. I will say,
though, that if the wood in the shed had not been
wet, I might not have gone to the cellar. Now
let that be an end of it. Understand?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>Don was silent and bit his lips. How long had
the fellow been down cellar? Had he seen
the merchandise and the powder that belonged to
his uncle? Or had he known that they were
there in the first place? Or had he gone down
merely to fetch dry wood? Over and over Don
asked himself the questions without being able to
answer them.</p>

<p>He glanced slyly at the Redcoat as he sat in
front of the fire, toasting his fingers. The man
was smiling to himself—a faint, inscrutable smile
that told nothing. The fellow might be smiling
because he had discovered the stuff, or he might
be smiling merely because of the discomfiture that
he knew he had caused the boy. Don could not
tell which answer was right.</p>

<p>At any rate he was glad that Snell was not in
the house when Aunt Martha entered two hours
later. If Snell had been there he would have
learned just exactly what she thought of him and
of his inquisitive visit to the cellar.</p>

<p>Hawkins, however, did enter while Don and
his aunt were discussing the matter. “What is
wrong?” he asked, glancing from one to the
other and then at the broken lock, which Don was
trying to fix.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“Your comrade,” replied Aunt Martha
steadily, “has seen fit to force his way into the
cellar to get wood with which to replenish the fire.
Our fire-wood is in the back shed, and he knows
it.”</p>

<p>Hawkins frowned and then, taking the lock
from Don’s hands, examined it.</p>

<p>“There is a great deal of wood in the back
shed, as you know,” continued Don’s aunt, “and
I know that it is not all wet as he says it is.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said Hawkins and placed the lock
on the table. “Just so.” And he went
abruptly to his room.</p>

<p>“There,” said Aunt Martha. “What did I
say? They’re all alike, these Redcoats.”</p>

<p>Later Snell returned, and while Don was helping
his aunt to prepare the supper the two heard
the sound of voices from up-stairs. Louder and
louder they became until it was quite plain
that the two soldiers were disagreeing over something.</p>

<p>Suddenly the voices ceased, and the ceiling
jarred with a heavy crash.</p>

<p>“O Donald! What are they doing?”</p>

<p>Steps sounded on the stairs, and a moment
later Hawkins, red of face, entered the room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
“I’d like a basin of hot water, if you please,” he
said.</p>

<p>Aunt Martha hastened to get it for him, and
presently he returned with it to the room. He
was down again in a few minutes and went out
into the street.</p>

<p>Don and his aunt had finished supper when
Hawkins again entered the house. “Here, my
lad,” he said and put a small package into Don’s
hand. “No,” he added, smiling, “it’s something
that you can very well accept. Don’t thank me
for it.” And he hurried up-stairs.</p>

<p>Don opened the package; it contained a new
lock similar to the one that Snell had broken.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” exclaimed Aunt Martha.
“Donald, I believe I wronged that man.”</p>

<p>When Snell came down-stairs the following
morning he made for the door without delay, but,
quick as he was, Aunt Martha observed that he
carried the marks of his encounter with Hawkins;
one eye was partly discolored, and his cheek was
swollen.</p>

<p>Later in the morning Don fixed the new lock in
place and then hurried off to find Jud and tell
him what had happened.</p>

<p>The day was warm for a day in late February;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
indeed the winter, which had begun with severe
weather, had proved to be mild after all. The
two boys directed their steps toward Walmer’s
wharf at the foot of Beech Street, where they sat
down in the sunlight with their backs against one
of the deserted warehouses.</p>

<p>“We’ll be safe here,” said Don; “no one is
likely to overhear what I’ve got to tell you, Jud.”</p>

<p>Jud leaned forward eagerly, and neither boy
observed a third person, who had followed them
at some distance and who now took a position just
within hearing round the corner of the silent
warehouse.</p>

<p>“Go on and tell it,” said Jud. “You’ve got
me all curious.”</p>

<p>“Well, in our cellar——” began Don, and the
hidden figure near the corner of the building
slunk a step nearer. “In our cellar there’s
quantities and quantities of linen and cloth and
some powder——” And Don told of the purchase
that his uncle had made before the blockade.</p>

<p>When he had finished that part of his story
Jud whistled softly. “My, but that’s risky
business, keeping it there,” he said. “Just
suppose——”</p>

<p>Don put his hand on his friend’s arm. “Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
so loud,” he whispered. “And, Jud, I know
you won’t breathe a word of it to anyone—not
even to your mother.”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>Don glanced round cautiously. The old
wharf apparently was quite deserted except for
themselves. The sun was shining brightly on the
water; the wind, blowing across the rough planks,
was rattling the loose shingles on a small fisherman’s
shack beside the big warehouse.</p>

<p>“Now for some reason,” Don continued,
“Snell, the Redcoat, broke into our cellar yesterday,
and that’s why I’m telling you this; I’m
afraid he knows what’s down there, and I want
you to help me if you can.”</p>

<p>Jud’s eyes snapped as he listened to his comrade’s
story of how Snell had broken the lock on
the cellar door.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Snell had not known of
what was in the cellar; it was curiosity more
than anything else that had prompted him to
break the lock. But it would not be long before
he knew just what was hidden away beneath the
little house in Pudding Lane, for before Don had
finished his story the figure that had been listening
so intently at the corner of the warehouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
drew back and walked quickly in the direction of
Beech Street. He had not gone far, however,
before he turned on his heel and strode carelessly
toward the wharf.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the boys spied Tom Bullard
walking toward them; his hands were in his
pockets, and he seemed wrapped in thought.
“Oh!” he exclaimed as if catching sight of them
for the first time. “Didn’t expect to find anybody
here.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” said Jud and turned his back.</p>

<p>Tom walked to the edge of the dock and, smiling
to himself, stood for some time, looking at the
sparkling waters. Then he turned and strode
back toward Beech Street.</p>

<p>Don glanced at his companion. “It’s lucky
he didn’t hear anything,” he said.</p>

<p>“If he had,” Jud replied with emphasis, “I’d
have pushed him into the water. What do you
suppose he was doing down here anyway?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just snoopin’ around,” replied Don
easily. “Since he’s become a sort of aide to old
Ruggles he’s been doing it, you know.”</p>

<p>The boys continued to talk in low tones for
some time. It was pleasant there on the dock in
the morning sunlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>Once Tom Bullard was out of their sight, he
started to run. He ran up Beech Street to
Shea’s Lane and from there made his way to
Common Street. Out on the Common some of
the companies were drilling, but Tom did not
pause to look at them. He crossed the Mall and
then at a fast walk went here and there among
the troops.</p>

<p>It took him almost half an hour to find the person
he was looking for, and when he did find him
at last he was so excited that he could hardly talk.
“Snell—Snell,” he began, “I’ve got—something—to—to——”</p>

<p>“Toot, toot!” said Snell, taking his arm.
“Get your breath before you tell it.”</p>

<p>Tom got his breath, enough of it anyway to tell
the Redcoat what he had overheard at the warehouse.
Then Snell was almost as much excited
as Tom was. He rubbed his swollen face
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Powder in the cellar of that house!” he exclaimed.
“Powder and fine cloth, and I like a
fool was down there and didn’t even see it!
You’re sure of it, Bullard?”</p>

<p>“I should say I am,” Tom replied. “Didn’t I
hear of it with my own ears?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“What are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“That’s for the two of us to decide together,”
replied Tom. “There’s no hurry, you know.
We want to do it in the best way.”</p>

<p>“Yes; in the best way.” Snell touched his
fingers lightly to his discolored eye. “In the
best way,” he repeated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>MARCH WINDS BLOW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was clear that Snell’s idea of the “best
way” to punish Don and his aunt was a way that
would also punish Hawkins, with whom Snell
was now on the bitterest of hostile terms; the two
soldiers neither spoke nor so much as glanced at
each other. But whatever Snell’s plan was, he
and Tom were slow in carrying it out.</p>

<p>No doubt they were busy with other things, for
the month of March began in a way that promised
to keep the Redcoats and the Tories occupied for
some little time. On the night of the second the
Continental batteries opened fire on the town.</p>

<p>Don and his Aunt Martha were in bed when
the firing began. For a long while they lay
listening to the crash, crash of the shells, which
seemed to be landing somewhere on the Common.
They heard Snell and Hawkins descend the stairs
and pass out into the street; then Aunt Martha
went to her nephew’s room. “Donald, my boy,”
she said, “what can it mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“It means that General Washington is preparing
to drive out old Howe and his men,” Don
replied confidently.</p>

<p>Don was nearer right than his aunt supposed.
The two following nights the bombardment was
repeated; it seemed that every gun in all the forts,
both friendly and hostile, was crashing forth and
illuminating the sky every few seconds.</p>

<p>And on the next morning, the fifth of March
and the anniversary of the Boston Massacre, the
whole town—and especially the British high-command—opened
their eyes wide with amazement.
Strong fortifications had sprung up, as if
by magic, on Dorchester Heights. Grim black
guns were pointing at the town; grim black guns
threatened the British fleet, which lay at anchor
out in the harbor.</p>

<p>Later in the morning Jud came hurrying into
Pudding Lane and entered the house; he was
trembling with excitement. “The time’s come!”
he cried. “Have you seen Dorchester Heights?
The Redcoats have either got to attack the
Heights the way they did Bunker’s Hill,
or they’ve got to clear out. I hope they attack!”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” exclaimed Aunt Martha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“It’s true,” declared Jud, “everything I’ve
told you. The Tories are scared silly!”</p>

<p>“Have you seen Tom Bullard?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Yes; I passed him on the way. He didn’t
seem scared, though—maybe he’s just too stupid.
He shook his fist at me, and he said, ‘You’d
better keep away from Pudding Lane if you
know what’s good for you.’”</p>

<p>“What did he mean?” asked Aunt Martha.</p>

<p>“Nothing, I guess,” said Don. “He likes to
talk, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the day the town was a
place of keen excitement. Howe, it seems, had
decided to accept Washington’s challenge and
attack the Heights. He was a brave man, and
his own honor as well as the honor of England
was at stake; he did not mean to yield weakly to
a band of “rebels.” He ordered twenty-four
hundred men to embark at once in transports;
under the command of Lord Percy, they were to
land at Castle William, from which place they
were to attack Dorchester Heights when night
fell.</p>

<p>Don and Jud saw the Redcoats assemble for
the attack and then march off. They saw Hawkins,
tall, erect, well-composed and confident;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
they saw Snell marching in another rank—and he
seemed anything but confident.</p>

<p>By noon virtually everyone in Boston and the
vicinity expected to see a terrible battle. It
seemed inevitable, for both sides were preparing
for it. While the British were mustering for the
attack on Dorchester Heights, Washington was
preparing to attack the British lines in Boston.
A fine detachment of four thousand troops were
on parade in Cambridge; under the command
of Generals Putnam, Greene and Sullivan
they were all ready to embark in boats at the
mouth of the river. And, as at Bunker Hill,
people had taken up points of vantage on
the tops of houses and on some of the near-by
hills.</p>

<p>But somewhat to the disappointment of Don
and Jud the two armies were not to meet. In
the afternoon the wind blew furiously, and a wild
destructive surf crashed and pounded on the
shores; no boat could possibly land with safety in
such a storm. Great limbs cracked and crashed
on the Common, and boards and shingles were
torn from many of the houses. The two boys,
hurrying along Long Acre, narrowly missed
being struck with a pile of stones that came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
tumbling from a chimney on a house near Rawson’s
Lane.</p>

<p>“Say, that was close, wasn’t it?” exclaimed
Jud. “A little more, Don, and you and I might
have been killed.”</p>

<p>Don laughed. “Come on, Jud, and let’s get
home. Just look how dark it’s getting! It’s
going to rain too.”</p>

<p>That evening the rain came down in torrents,
and the wind continued to blow with unabated
fury. And the next day, the sixth, found the
waves in the harbor high and confused. Both
armies waited; and Washington’s men strengthened
their fortifications.</p>

<p>The next day Howe found himself in a critical
and perplexing situation. His army was at the
mercy of the Continental batteries, and the fleet
was unable to ride in safety in the harbor. To
remain in Boston would be to expose his men to
the greatest danger; to withdraw would be to lose
much valuable property. But Howe was first of
all a soldier, and after a hurried council he determined
to withdraw to save his army. Preparations
began at once.</p>

<p>“They’re going, Aunt Martha!” cried Don,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
bursting in upon his aunt. “The Redcoats are
going to leave the town!”</p>

<p>“And what will they do to the town before
they go? O Donald, what will they do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Don thoughtfully.
“They could do a lot of bad things, I suppose,
but, Aunt Martha, I don’t think they’ll do anything
very bad. I tell you it won’t be well for
them if they set fire to any buildings.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m afraid of most of all,” said
his aunt.</p>

<p>Many other persons besides Aunt Martha
were worried about the fate of Boston. In the
Continental army itself there was many a soldier
who wondered what would become of his home
and of his relatives who had refused to leave the
town.</p>

<p>After a little group of prominent citizens had
sent a petition to Washington, begging him to
take no measures that would injure the town, the
two armies reached a tacit understanding that the
British might embark without the Continentals
molesting them. Nevertheless, the American
army held itself in readiness to act in case the
enemy did any damage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Washington was strengthening his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
defenses round the town. On the evening of the
ninth he sent a strong detachment to plant a battery
on Nook’s Hill to threaten the fleet; but the
British learned of his purpose, and almost all
night Don and his aunt lay awake and listened
to the roar of cannon.</p>

<p>The next day Howe issued a printed proclamation
that almost caused Aunt Martha to lose
heart. Don and Jud brought her word of it.</p>

<p>“All linen and woolen goods have to be turned
over to Crean Brush, the Tory,” whispered Don—for
Snell was up-stairs. “Old Howe knows
there’s stuff hidden in the town that our men can
use. That’s why he wants it.”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha glanced involuntarily at the door
to the cellar. “We’d best give it up, Donald,”
she said. “I’d hoped we could keep it, but I see
now that we can’t. Oh, what a foolish woman I
was!”</p>

<p>“No, Aunt Martha—no!” Don’s voice
trembled in spite of himself. “Nobody knows
we have the stuff, and the Redcoats can’t possibly
search every cellar.”</p>

<p>“Don is right, Aunt Martha,” whispered Jud.
“Don’t you turn it over to them!”</p>

<p>“But if they come and search——” Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
Martha checked herself suddenly, for Snell was
coming down the stairs.</p>

<p>Without looking to right or left, the Redcoat
crossed the room and went out on the street.</p>

<p>“Did he hear us?” asked Don’s aunt.</p>

<p>“Not likely,” replied Jud. “Now don’t you
say one word about that stuff in the cellar.”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha shook her head in uncertainty,
but she finally decided to do as the boys had
advised.</p>

<p>The next day Crean Brush began his work of
searching for hidden supplies. Stores were
broken into, and goods of all sorts were carried
off in violation of strict orders that Howe had
issued. Lawless bands of soldiers, sailors,
marines and Tories went from house to house
and took what pleased them. And while they
were doing that, the army was transporting its
equipment to the water-front to be shipped
aboard the vessels.</p>

<p>All day Don and his aunt remained in the
house, anxiously expecting every minute to hear
the sound of Crean Brush’s men outside. Jud
did not put in an appearance until after dark, and
then he remained only for a few moments to say
that a searching party had come to his house but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
had found nothing. “If they had,” he added,
“Ma and I would have been as surprised as they,
I guess.”</p>

<p>Don and his aunt laughed. Before Jud went
away he got Don to one side. “Say, Don,” he
whispered, “you’ve got powder in the cellar
along with that other stuff, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a little,” Don replied.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jud, “if I were you I’d move it
somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“Why would you do that?”</p>

<p>“Well, at the rate Crean Brush and his gangs
are going they’re pretty sure to reach your house
sooner or later; and if they search it and find that
powder—well, I don’t know what they won’t
do.”</p>

<p>“I guess they’ll do enough even if they just
find the cloth and stuff,” said Don. “So it
seems to me I might as well leave it all together.”</p>

<p>“No, Don; do as I tell you!” Jud’s voice was
low and excited.</p>

<p>Don laughed. “I never knew you to be so
cautious before, Jud.”</p>

<p>But Jud seized his friend’s arm. “Take my
advice for once and do it,” he urged. “I’ll help
you move it now if you like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“No, not now,” replied Don. “Maybe
later.”</p>

<p>“All right, then.” And Jud hurried out into
the night.</p>

<small>CREAN BRUSH’S MEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Don</span> said nothing to his aunt about the powder
in the cellar. Indeed after Jud had gone he
thought little of it and of the advice his companion
had given. Don and his aunt waited
until Snell and Hawkins had gone up-stairs, and
then Aunt Martha said:</p>

<p>“Well, Donald, I think we’re almost at the
end of the story.”</p>

<p>“What story?” asked Don.</p>

<p>Aunt Martha smiled. “I merely meant,” she
replied, “that in a few more days we’ll be all
through with our suffering—or else there will be
more suffering, far more terrible than some of us
can bear perhaps.”</p>

<p>“You’re still afraid they’ll burn the town?”</p>

<p>“I can’t get it off my mind. Just look at
Charlestown across the water. What a snug
little place to live in it used to be—and just see it
now!”</p>

<p>Don was silent for a few moments. “Everything
has gone pretty well so far,” he said at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“And maybe before long we’ll see Uncle David
and Glen.”</p>

<p>“O Donald, I’ve prayed for it!”</p>

<p>“I certainly wish that one or the other were
here now.” Don was thinking of Crean Brush
and of his lawless men.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. Well, we’d best go to bed now.
Another night—another night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and before you know it General Washington
will be here, and the Redcoats will be on
the water.”</p>

<p>Up-stairs in his room, Don lay for some time
listening to the sound of firing that seemed to
come from the direction of Noddles Island. The
night was dark, and a strong wind was blowing
against the little windows. From across the hall
came the sounds of snoring and of heavy breathing;
apparently both Snell and Hawkins were
asleep. Don closed his eyes and lay back on the
pillow; but the position was uncomfortable, and
he turned on his side. That position also uncomfortable,
and he turned on his other side.
Then his foot began to itch, then his back, then
his neck. He could not sleep.</p>

<p>At last he sat up in bed. Now he could hear
the regular breathing of his aunt; no doubt she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
was exhausted with the day’s worry. Once more
he tried to get to sleep, but it was of no use. He
raised himself on his elbow. “Now what in
thunder ails me?” he thought.</p>

<p>There was something—something that somebody
had said. What was it? The next instant
he thought of Jud and of what he had said about
the powder. “That’s it!” he said to himself.
“What if Crean Brush and his men should find it
in the cellar and, drunk as some of them were
likely to be, touch a light to it!”</p>

<p>The thought made him spring part way out of
bed. Aunt Martha was still breathing regularly.
That was enough for Don to make up
his mind.</p>

<p>He began softly to dress. The house was cold,
and he shivered as he put on his shirt and his
trousers. In a few minutes he was all dressed
except for his shoes. Then he made his way
cautiously to the head of the stairs. Once he
stepped on a loose, squeaky board and heard his
aunt turn and sigh; but she did not waken.
Neither did either of the soldiers.</p>

<p>Down the steep stairs Don went on all fours.
In the kitchen he found the candlestick, but he
did not light it until he had opened the door to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
the cellar. Half-way down the old steps he
paused, undecided whether to go the rest of the
way. Then he took another step, but it required
courage. The flickering light of the candle sent
grotesque, ghostlike shadows dancing along the
walls, like great unearthly black vultures.</p>

<p>He wondered whether he were doing right and
then wished that Jud were with him. But, taking
a fresh grip on himself, he went the rest of
the way.</p>

<p>Trembling with nervousness, he set the candle
on a box and looked about him. All around lay
the goods that David Hollis had bought in a
hasty moment—large bales and small bales piled
side by side and on top of one another. With
shaking fingers Don examined them, going
quickly from one to another. Then suddenly he
came upon the powder; there were one small keg
and seven canvas bags of it lying close to the foot
of the steps.</p>

<p>He lifted the keg and then lifted one of the
bags; the keg was much the heavier. “Now
what shall I do with the stuff?” he wondered.</p>

<p>For a few moments he stood in deep thought.
The old cellar was cold and damp, and a draft
from somewhere was stirring the flame of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
candle. “I know,” he said at last and bent over
the keg again.</p>

<p>With an effort he lifted it and started up the
stairs. In a moment or two he no longer felt
cold. It was no easy task to get that heavy keg
up the stairs. From step to step he half rolled,
half lifted it, and in a few minutes he was sweating
with the exertion. Another thing that made
the work hard was that he did not dare make any
noise.</p>

<p>At last he got the keg to the top, and then after
a brief rest he carried it through the room to the
back shed, the door to which had only a latch.
There he found another candle, and lighting it,
set it on the floor. Five minutes later he had
the keg hidden well at the back of the woodpile.</p>

<p>Then he returned for the bags. One at a time
he carried them—all seven of them—up the steps
and stowed them close to the keg. Having
covered them well with the wood and having
snuffed both candles, he returned to his room and
began hastily to undress. He was congratulating
himself on not having disturbed anyone when
he heard the voice of his aunt:</p>

<p>“Donald, are you awake?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>Don paused in the act of removing his shirt.
He did not reply at once.</p>

<p>“Donald!”</p>

<p>“Uh-hm,” said Don.</p>

<p>“There—you <i>are</i> awake!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear a noise down-stairs a few
minutes ago?”</p>

<p>“Noise? H’m—what noise?” Don was in
bed by this time and had the covers well round his
head.</p>

<p>He heard his aunt sigh heavily. How could
her nephew sleep so soundly? The good woman
was really sorry that she had wakened him!</p>

<p>It was not long before Don was asleep indeed.
Nor did he waken when Snell and Hawkins descended
the stairs in the morning. Aunt Martha
had to call him four times before he roused and
crawled sleepily from his bed.</p>

<p>“My goodness,” said his aunt as she was putting
the breakfast on the table, “you’re surely a
sleepyhead this morning, Donald Alden. Ah,
well, you’re a growing boy, and you need your
rest.”</p>

<p>Don grinned up at her. “You have a speck
on your specs, Aunt Martha.”</p>

<p>“Donald!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“A speck of dust on your spectacles, Aunt
Martha.”</p>

<p>His aunt hastily removed the speck with the
corner of her apron. “Now just see that
candle,” she said. “I thought it was just yesterday
that I put a fresh one in the stick—but see
how short it is now!”</p>

<p>Don examined the candle with great care, as
if to find out what had become of the rest of it.
“Why, it seems that——” he began and then
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>From the street came the sound of shouting
and of heavy footsteps on the cobblestones.</p>

<p>“O Donald, they’ve come. It’s—it’s——”</p>

<p>“Now, you be easy, Aunt Martha,” Don interrupted
her.</p>

<p>Though he spoke calmly he was anything but
calm in his mind. He went to the door, and just
as he reached it someone pounded heavily on the
outside.</p>

<p>“Open the door, Donald,” said Aunt Martha,
“or they’ll beat it down.”</p>

<p>Don flung the door open and to his great
astonishment looked full into the leering face of
Tom Bullard. Beside him were three of Crean
Brush’s men, and behind them, grinning insolently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
was the Redcoat Snell. In a moment all
were inside, and Snell was striding toward the
door to the cellar. “We’ll find something this
time, boys!” he said exultantly.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, what is it you wish?” It was
the voice of Aunt Martha, and Don, glancing at
her as she stood slight but well poised beside the
fireplace, thought she looked fully ten years
younger.</p>

<p>There was something in her voice that made
everyone turn and look at her. “A-hem,”
began one of the Tories—a big fellow who
obviously was the leader. “A-hem, we’ve come
to search your house.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Snell, “we’ve come to get that
powder which you’ve got in the cellar.” With
his bayonet he began to pry at the lock on the
cellar door.</p>

<p>Aunt Martha looked helplessly at her nephew.
Tom Bullard, standing near the door, made a
sneering remark to the Tory beside him, and Don
clenched his fists and started for him. But he
had taken only two steps when he checked himself
and turned to the leader. “You’ve no right in
that cellar!” he cried. “You’ve no right in this
house!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Hold your young tongue,” said the Tory
sharply. “There’s powder in this cellar, and we
know it. That’s what we want, and that’s what
we’re a-goin’ to get.”</p>

<p>“There’s not a grain of powder in the cellar,”
Don replied.</p>

<p>Aunt Martha’s eyebrows lifted in astonishment;
never in her life had she known her nephew
to tell an untruth, even in fun.</p>

<p>“No powder?” repeated the Tory. “Well,
now that’s curious—very curious—because both
these fellows say there is.” He indicated Snell
and Tom.</p>

<p>“I’ll stake my life on it,” said Tom, stepping
forward and throwing out his chest.</p>

<p>“And I’ll stake mine,” said Snell.</p>

<p>“Well, hurry up and get that lock off, and
we’ll soon see,” said the leader.</p>

<p>Snell inserted the bayonet and gave a wrench.
Don was thinking, not of the powder, but of the
bales of cloth at the foot of the stairs. In a few
minutes they would find them, and then things
would go hard with him and his aunt. Well, he
had done his best, but what wouldn’t he have done
to keep them out of the cellar altogether!</p>

<p>“Blasted lock!” muttered Snell and gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
another fierce wrench; there was a sharp crack,
and his bayonet was in two pieces.</p>

<p>Infuriated, the Redcoat hacked away with the
short end that was in his hand, and in a few
moments the lock clattered to the floor. He had
opened the door and was about to go down when
a sharp command behind him made him turn as if
he had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>“Snell, you hound, what does this mean!”
Harry Hawkins, gun in hand, crossed the
threshold; he had just returned from the drill
grounds.</p>

<p>Snell’s face had gone suddenly white, and he
only stood and looked.</p>

<p>“It means,” said the leader, “that we’re about
to get some ammunition that these rebels have
hidden in the cellar.”</p>

<p>“It’s not true, sir!” cried Don, turning to
Hawkins. “It’s not true. There is no ammunition
in the cellar—not a speck!”</p>

<p>Hawkins looked steadily at Aunt Martha.
“That is true, I suppose?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“My nephew has never told a lie in his life,
and, sir, he—he is telling the truth now. There
is no ammunition in the cellar.”</p>

<p>“They’re both lying——” Tom Bullard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
stopped as abruptly as he had begun as Hawkins
whirled and faced him.</p>

<p>For a long moment no one spoke; then Aunt
Martha addressed Hawkins: “These men have
taken it upon themselves to enter my house unbidden.
Five men against one boy and a woman!
They have no right here——”</p>

<p>“Oh, enough of that!” cried the leader and
strode toward the cellar door.</p>

<p>“Halt where you are!” exclaimed Hawkins,
and as the Tory hesitated the soldier raised
his gun a few inches. “Let me see your orders.”</p>

<p>“Orders! Orders to search a rebel’s house?”</p>

<p>“Now, see here,”—Hawkins’s voice was hard
and cold, and his eyes were like points of fire—“this
thing has gone about as far as I want to see
it go. I’ll stand sponsor for the boy and the
woman—and I’ve got a good reason for doing it.
Now, my friends, you’ll oblige me by leaving the
house——”</p>

<p>“Why—why, you don’t mean to say——” began
the leader.</p>

<p>“At once,” finished Hawkins and tapped the
stock of his musket.</p>

<p>Tom Bullard was already outside the door, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Snell and the three Tories did not move.
Whereupon Hawkins stepped swiftly to the
cellar door and, slamming it shut, quickly drew
his bayonet and affixed it to the end of his piece.</p>

<p>“By heaven, you’ll hear of this!” cried the
leader and backed slowly across the room. “I
promise you I’ll see you in the guard-house before
nightfall!”</p>

<p>“And,” added another, “we’ll be here again,
and we’ll bring Brush, himself, along.”</p>

<p>Hawkins made no answer but followed the
three across the room and, when they had gone
out, held the door open for Snell, who lost no
time in joining them. The sudden turn of
affairs had left the fellow speechless, for he had
expected to find the powder and then to accuse
Hawkins of knowing that it was hidden in the
cellar.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” exclaimed Don a few moments later,
“it’s true, what I told you, every word of it, but,
oh——”</p>

<p>“Say no more,” interrupted Hawkins, smiling.
“Say no more. I don’t doubt your word; and if
I had I should have stopped them, Tories as they
are. But had they been the King’s men, I should
not have interfered in any circumstances.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“But you’ve rendered us a great service——”
Aunt Martha began.</p>

<p>“It is nothing compared with the service your
nephew once rendered me. I owe him my life,
and I trust that sometime we may meet again—in
better days.” Hawkins turned and walked to
the stairs.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon Don explained to his
aunt what he had done with the powder the night
before, and a look of relief came into her tired
eyes. “I knew there must be some explanation,”
she said simply. “And,” she added,
smiling slightly, “that accounts for the noise I
heard last night and for the shortness of the
candle.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they’ll return?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” his aunt replied.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>DON MEETS GENERAL WASHINGTON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Crean Brush’s</span> men did not return to the
house in Pudding Lane; they had more than
enough to do in the excitement of the withdrawal.
Nor did Snell give any further trouble; no doubt
the fellow feared the strong arm of Hawkins.</p>

<p>On the sixteenth of the month both Redcoats
carried all their equipment from the house and
did not return. All that Hawkins said as he left
the room was “Better days, young sire; better
days, my good woman.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, let us hope for them,” replied Aunt
Martha.</p>

<p>Don only smiled, and Hawkins, as he closed
the door, smiled in return. That was the last
that Don ever saw of him during the war.</p>

<p>The following day, which was Sunday, the
Redcoats began to embark; and not only the
soldiers left the town, but the Tories also. Don
and Jud caught a glimpse of Tom Bullard and
his father carrying some of their household effects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
down King Street. The faces of both Tories
showed anger and mortification.</p>

<p>“Come on,” whispered Jud, “let’s get ahead
of ’em and then turn and give ’em a yell. We’ll
never see them again.”</p>

<p>“No, Jud,” Don replied, “I’m just a little
sorry for them. Oh, yes, I know Tom’s acted
mean, but just think what’s happening to him
and his father; they’re going to Halifax, so I’ve
heard, and all they can take along is just that
little bit of stuff they’re carrying. Their fine
house up on Hanover Street is lost, and they’ll
never get it again, because they daren’t ever return.”</p>

<p>Jud did not reply but glanced at his companion
sidewise. And so the two boys stood and
watched their enemy until he and his father had
disappeared among the throngs of Redcoats and
Tories at the foot of the street.</p>

<p>The last boatload of soldiers and refugees had
not been long away from the shore when the Continental
soldiers entered the town by way of the
Neck and by boats across the river. The boys
spied one of the first patrols on the southern
end of the Common and hastened toward
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“I want to find out first of all about Uncle
Dave and Glen,” Don said to Jud.</p>

<p>But none of the men in the patrol knew either
of the two men. Kindly fellows they were, all
of them, and they laughed and joked with the
boys and with one another as they marched along
toward the Mall.</p>

<p>“Say!” exclaimed Jud when they had gone
past. “I’m so glad to see those buff and blue
uniforms I can hardly say how I feel. I feel as
if I’d burst!”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” said Don, “except that I almost
feel like—well, like when you’re so happy it
makes the tears come into your eyes. Look, here
come some more of our men!”</p>

<p>Probably most of the good people of Boston
felt as Don and Jud felt; certainly there were
many who shed tears of joy as they stood in their
doorways and watched the various detachments
of Continentals arriving. There was good
reason for the tears, for the people who shed them
had suffered like martyrs during long months
of privation, insult and oppression—to say nothing
of disease, for smallpox had broken out in the
poorer parts of the town.</p>

<p>The first words that greeted Don as he entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
his aunt’s house were, “Donald, my boy, did—did
you see your uncle?”</p>

<p>“No, Aunt Martha. I asked at least a score
of our men about him, but none of them seemed
to know him. But, O Aunt Martha, ain’t it fine!
The Redcoats are gone!”</p>

<p>“When I’ve seen your uncle I shall rejoice,”
his aunt replied and turned quickly away.</p>

<p>One thing that annoyed Don the following day
was that he failed to see General Washington,
who had entered the town and had dined with
Mr. James Bowdoin at the home of Mr. Erving,
both of whom were friends of Don’s uncle. Nor
did Don see Washington the next day, for the
general had returned to Cambridge.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the twentieth, the main body
of the Continental troops entered the town, with
flags flying and drums beating.</p>

<p>“Watch out for my uncle and for Glen
Drake,” Don said to Jud as the two boys stood
on a crowded street corner waiting for the head
of the column to appear.</p>

<p>“Yes, and you keep your eyes open for my
father and for my brothers.”</p>

<p>From far off came the sound of drums and
fifes. The crowd at the corner, mostly boys and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
women, moved uneasily. “It’s Yankee Doodle
they’re playing,” whispered Jud. “Say, doesn’t
that sound good!”</p>

<p>“It surely does!” agreed Don.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the regular tramp, tramp of
marching feet reached the ears of the eager little
group.</p>

<p>“Here they are!”</p>

<p>A cavalcade of horses, white, black and chestnut,
had turned a corner. Behind them came
the foot soldiers, resplendent in buff and blue,
ruddy of face, keen of eye.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah!” Don and Jud swung
their caps high into the air. “Hurrah!” cried
the rest of the little group.</p>

<p>But for the most part the main body of Continentals
were greeted with few cheers. The
people of the besieged town had suffered too
much under Howe and the British; most of the
inhabitants remained at doors and windows and
were content to wave their hands.</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried Jud.</p>

<p>“Who? Who?”</p>

<p>“General Washington! See, there on the big
horse! Don, just look how——”</p>

<p>But Don was not listening. All his attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
was given to the man who sat with such ease and
dignity on the big horse. Never had he seen
anyone who looked so thoroughly like his ideal of
a soldier. Tall and well-proportioned, the general
looked truly noble and majestic. His coat
was blue with buff facings, and on each shoulder
he wore a rich epaulette. His under dress was
buff, and he wore a black cockade in his hat. At
his side hung an elegant small-sword.</p>

<p>The cavalcade swung past, and the two boys
turned to each other at the same time. “Jinks!”
exclaimed Jud. “Wasn’t he fine!”</p>

<p>“Fine!” echoed Don and with a deep sigh
turned again to view the troops.</p>

<p>Several ranks of foot soldiers had already
passed, but the boys sharply scrutinized those
who were approaching. Company after company
swung past. Then Jud suddenly spied his
father and the next instant one of his brothers.
Both recognized him and smiled as they passed.
A few minutes later he spied the other brother.</p>

<p>Don was worried; not a man had he seen who
looked in the least like his uncle or Glen. Company
after company, regiment after regiment,
marched by, and somehow Don felt his lips beginning
to quiver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“It’s too bad, Don,” said Jud. “I’d hoped
we’d see Glen and your uncle right off. Here’s
the end of the column. Maybe they’ll come
later.”</p>

<p>Don made no answer; he was wondering how
he could tell his aunt that Uncle David had not
entered with the troops. He bit his under lip.
Maybe his uncle’s wound had not healed.
Maybe——</p>

<p>“I’ll see you later, Don,” Jud was saying.
“Won’t Ma be glad when I tell her!”</p>

<p>Don made his way dejectedly to the little house
in Pudding Lane. He could just picture his
aunt’s face when he told her the news. He
opened the door and with head down stepped
inside; the next instant, when he lifted his eyes,
he could hardly believe what he saw. There,
standing beside his aunt near the fireplace, resplendent
in a captain’s uniform was—David
Hollis! His arm was round Aunt Martha’s
waist, and she was laughing and crying both at
the same time. And there in one corner of the
room, looking almost as he had looked when Don
had first seen him, was Glen Drake!</p>

<p>“Donald, my lad!”</p>

<p>Don felt the breath almost squeezed from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
body, for his uncle was a big man. And then he
felt the bones in his hand crunch as the old trapper
greeted him.</p>

<p>“Oh, this seems almost too good to be true!”
Aunt Martha was saying.</p>

<p>For the next fifteen minutes questions and
answers followed one another in quick succession.
Then at last Don asked gravely: “Uncle David,
where did you come from? I never saw you in
the column.”</p>

<p>David Hollis laughed heartily. “I saw you,
though; my company led the column. But you
were so interested in our general that you didn’t
have eyes for anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Don,” said Glen; “he’s a fine
man to look at, the general is.”</p>

<p>“What a hard time you’ve had here!” said
Uncle David. “Your aunt has been telling me.
My boy, I’m proud of you for the way you’ve
acted and especially for the way you kept the
Redcoats from getting that stuff in the cellar.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Don, you sure played the fox that
time,” said Glen. “And now that the Redcoats
have gone, I’m thinking you and I and that other
boy will be able to do a little trapping in the
woods together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“Now, David,” said Aunt Martha, “what are
we going to do with the stuff in the cellar? I
don’t want it to remain there; truly I don’t.”</p>

<p>David Hollis laughed and turned to his
nephew. “It’s yours, Donald,” he said; “you’ve
earned the right to it, I think; do with it as you
wish. Perhaps you can sell it.”</p>

<p>“Me—sell it!” exclaimed Don.</p>

<p>“It’s yours. My friend in the South doesn’t
want it.”</p>

<p>“With all that cloth you won’t have to worry
about breeches now for the rest of your life,
Don,” said Glen grinning.</p>

<p>Don did not reply; he was thinking hard.</p>

<p>The next morning while Glen and his uncle
were with the troops he entered the cellar and
spent almost an hour making a list of the supplies
that were there. Then he hurried up-stairs and
went out into the street.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he was standing in front of
a lieutenant in a large hallway. “I’d like very
much to see General Washington,” he said.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said the lieutenant; “and what may
be your business?”</p>

<p>“I have something to give him.”</p>

<p>“Indeed. You don’t look as if you had much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
to give.” The lieutenant smiled good-naturedly.
“I’m sorry to have to turn you away, but the
general is a busy man these days.”</p>

<p>Don fell back a pace and looked around him.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry——” the lieutenant was saying,
when a door opened, and a tall figure stepped
into the hall.</p>

<p>Like a flash the lieutenant and several other
officers who were standing near by snapped to
attention. It was Washington himself that was
walking quietly toward the entrance. Don
gulped once, and then before he knew what he
was doing he had exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Sir—General Washington!”</p>

<p>The general turned, and Don pulled his slip of
paper from his pocket and handed it to him.
“This is a list of goods that were in our cellar all
during the occupation,” he said. “My uncle,
Capt. David Hollis, gave them to me for keeping
the Redcoats from getting them. I want to give
them to our army.”</p>

<p>Washington glanced at the paper—he seemed
to read everything on it in a single glance—and
then turned to the boy. “The army will be very
grateful to have these supplies,” he said. “I
thank you, my boy. You are a true patriot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>Don colored to the roots of his hair as he
watched the general hand the paper to the
lieutenant and then turn and smile and pass into
the street.</p>

<p>“Donald!” cried Aunt Martha as Don burst
noisily into the room. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“I gave the supplies to Washington!” cried
Don. “I saw him, Aunt Martha, and he said
the army would be glad to get them. You know
they need stuff for uniforms, and especially
powder.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Donald! It’s the best thing
you could have done with them.”</p>

<p>“And, Aunt Martha, he said I was a true
patriot!”</p>

<p>“You are, Donald; you’ve helped the cause.”</p>

<p>In another minute Don was, closely followed
by Sailor, on his way to Hog Alley to tell Jud
the news. His eyes were bright, and his face
was flushed as he ran along the streets, which
now were filled with Continental uniforms. He
had done something to help his country at last.</p>
